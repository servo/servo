# Running wrench on android built with master cargo-apk results in a crash
# due to a mismatched version of android_glue (a dependency of winit).
# Override it to use a suitable version of android_glue.
# See https://github.com/rust-windowing/android-rs-glue/issues/239.
# This can be removed once a new version of android_glue is published to crates.io.
