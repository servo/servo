# When linking `libOSMesa.dylib` Meson uses options provided by `llvm-config`.
# The binary for `llvm-config` in Firefox CI comes from a native Linux clang,
# which gives the link options for the Linux libLLVM-11.so in the Linux clang.
# However, we want to link against a native macOS clang's libLLVM.dylib, which
# we have available in a separate directory.
# Meson will still have -lLLVM-11 on the command line, but the linker will
# only warn that it has the wrong format (because it's not for macOS).
