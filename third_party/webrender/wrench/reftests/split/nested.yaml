# This tests have a non-preserve3d stacking context nested within
# preserve-3d sub-tree. This nested context is still getting baked in
# and participates (as a whole) in plane splitting.
# It is layed out in the same plane as the parent, so should be ordered
# last, given that it's coming later than the parent.
