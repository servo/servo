# This test ensures that a clip that is segmented, with segments
# that have no intersection with the world-space outer bounds of
# the clip rectangle render correctly. In this case the first clip
# defines the outer bounds of the clip rectangle and the rotation
# ensures that the inner clip isn't optimized away completely. The
# segments of the rounded corner clip don't have any intersection at
# all with the clip in area from the outer clip, so they shouldn't
# affect the rendering of the green square.
