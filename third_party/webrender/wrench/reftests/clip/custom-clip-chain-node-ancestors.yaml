# This test ensures that custom clip chains are not affected by the ancestors
# of their clipping nodes. In this case the node, 3, will probably be optimized
# away since its ancestor 2 has a tighter bounding rect. On the other hand, a
# clip chain which includes 3 should only get the rectangle specified by that
# node and not be affected by 2 at all.
