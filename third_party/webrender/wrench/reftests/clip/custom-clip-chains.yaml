# This tests a clip chain (clipid=6) that is composed of two clips (clipid=3
# and clipid=4) with a parent clip chain (composed of two more clips (clipid=1
# and clipid=2). This effectively  tests a "complex" clip chain that includes
# and is applied to multiple non-hierarchical reference frames as well as
# having a similarly complicated parent. Each clip is a rounded corner which,
# when rotated, clips a box with all corners rounded.
