# Test that transformed content is clipped out properly by clips with a different transform.
# Also verifies that we aren't trying to render the clip mask at all for this clip-out case.
#
# The clip is a 500x500 rounded cornered rectangle rotated by 15 degrees. It fully contains the
# bounds of the red rect and has a clip-out mode (within the conservative logic of our
# `project_inner_rect` transformation), so nothing is visible, and no mask is rendered.
