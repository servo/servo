# see: https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-css3-images-20120417/#repeating-gradients
# the spec says that repeating gradients with color stops in the same offset
# must render as a solid rect with color equal to the average color of the
# gradient. Gecko and Blink seem to draw it with color equal to the last stop
# so that is the behavior tested here
