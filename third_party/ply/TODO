The PLY to-do list:

1. Finish writing the C Preprocessor module.  Started in the
   file ply/cpp.py

2. Create and document libraries of useful tokens.

3. Expand the examples/yply tool that parses bison/yacc
   files.

4. Think of various diabolical things to do with the
   new yacc internals.  For example, it is now possible
   to specify grammrs using completely different schemes
   than the reflection approach used by PLY.
