# The first line here should be the "servo" argument (without quotes) and the
# last should be the URL to load.
# Blank lines and those beginning with a '#' are ignored.
# Each line should be a separate parameter as would be parsed by the shell.
# For example, "servo -p 10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust" would take 4
# lines (the "-p" and "10" are separate even though they are related).
