# Code of Conduct

The Servo Project follows the [**Rust Code of Conduct**](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct), with the differences below.

Our code of conduct applies to the [Servo Zulip channels](https://servo.zulipchat.com/), [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/servo), and all official Servo venues, rather than the Rust project.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify one of our designated contacts:
* Delan Azabani (she/her) <dazabani@igalia.com>
* Martin Robinson (he/him) <mrobinson@igalia.com>
* Manuel Rego Casasnovas (he/him) <rego@igalia.com>

*Note: If you modify this file, please keep this file in sync with <https://servo.org/coc/>.*
