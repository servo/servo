///
/// The `webview` argument passed to each callback is a temporary handle.
/// Its lifetime is limited to the duration of the callback. The
/// embedder must not retain or use handle after the callback returns.
/// The callback must not pass it to `servo_webview_free` or any other
/// function that takes ownership of a `WebView`.
///
/// The `user_data` pointer is owned by the embedder.
/// The validity and lifetime of `user_data` is the embedder's responsibility.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The embedder must ensure that for all function-pointer fields of
/// this struct:
///
/// - A non-null function pointer is a valid C ABI callback function
///   matching the exact signature shown.
/// - The function pointers and `user_data` remain valid for as long as
///   this delegate is associated with any `WebView`.
/// - The callback does not unwind across the FFI boundary.
/// - The `webview` argument is not retained or used after the callback
///   returns and is not passed to `servo_webview_free` or any other
///   function that takes ownership of the `WebView`.
