class Auth(BaseClient):
    """
    Authentication related API end-points for Taskcluster and related
    services. These API end-points are of interest if you wish to:
      * Authorize a request signed with Taskcluster credentials,
      * Manage clients and roles,
      * Inspect or audit clients and roles,
      * Gain access to various services guarded by this API.

    Note that in this service "authentication" refers to validating the
    correctness of the supplied credentials (that the caller posesses the
    appropriate access token). This service does not provide any kind of user
    authentication (identifying a particular person).

    ### Clients
    The authentication service manages _clients_, at a high-level each client
    consists of a `clientId`, an `accessToken`, scopes, and some metadata.
    The `clientId` and `accessToken` can be used for authentication when
    calling Taskcluster APIs.

    The client's scopes control the client's access to Taskcluster resources.
    The scopes are *expanded* by substituting roles, as defined below.

    ### Roles
    A _role_ consists of a `roleId`, a set of scopes and a description.
    Each role constitutes a simple _expansion rule_ that says if you have
    the scope: `assume:<roleId>` you get the set of scopes the role has.
    Think of the `assume:<roleId>` as a scope that allows a client to assume
    a role.

    As in scopes the `*` kleene star also have special meaning if it is
    located at the end of a `roleId`. If you have a role with the following
    `roleId`: `my-prefix*`, then any client which has a scope staring with
    `assume:my-prefix` will be allowed to assume the role.

    ### Guarded Services
    The authentication service also has API end-points for delegating access
    to some guarded service such as AWS S3, or Azure Table Storage.
    Generally, we add API end-points to this server when we wish to use
    Taskcluster credentials to grant access to a third-party service used
    by many Taskcluster components.

        The `level` parameter can be `read-write` or `read-only` and determines
        which type of credentials are returned. Please note that the `level`
        parameter is required in the scope guarding access.  The bucket name must
        not contain `.`, as recommended by Amazon.

        This method can only allow access to a whitelisted set of buckets.  To add
        a bucket to that whitelist, contact the Taskcluster team, who will add it to
        the appropriate IAM policy.  If the bucket is in a different AWS account, you
        will also need to add a bucket policy allowing access from the Taskcluster
        account.  That policy should look like this:

        ```
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "allow-taskcluster-auth-to-delegate-access",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::692406183521:root"
              },
              "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>",
                "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        The credentials are set to expire after an hour, but this behavior is
        subject to change. Hence, you should always read the `expires` property
        from the response, if you intend to maintain active credentials in your
        application.

        Please note that your `prefix` may not start with slash `/`. Such a prefix
        is allowed on S3, but we forbid it here to discourage bad behavior.

        Also note that if your `prefix` doesn't end in a slash `/`, the STS
        credentials may allow access to unexpected keys, as S3 does not treat
        slashes specially.  For example, a prefix of `my-folder` will allow
        access to `my-folder/file.txt` as expected, but also to `my-folder.txt`,
        which may not be intended.

        Finally, note that the `PutObjectAcl` call is not allowed.  Passing a canned
        ACL other than `private` to `PutObject` is treated as a `PutObjectAcl` call, and
        will result in an access-denied error from AWS.  This limitation is due to a
        security flaw in Amazon S3 which might otherwise allow indefinite access to
        uploaded objects.

        **EC2 metadata compatibility**, if the querystring parameter
        `?format=iam-role-compat` is given, the response will be compatible
        with the JSON exposed by the EC2 metadata service. This aims to ease
        compatibility for libraries and tools built to auto-refresh credentials.
