    The queue, typically available at `queue.taskcluster.net`, is responsible
    for accepting tasks and track their state as they are executed by
    workers. In order ensure they are eventually resolved.

    This document describes AMQP exchanges offered by the queue, which allows
    third-party listeners to monitor tasks as they progress to resolution.
    These exchanges targets the following audience:
     * Schedulers, who takes action after tasks are completed,
     * Workers, who wants to listen for new or canceled tasks (optional),
     * Tools, that wants to update their view as task progress.

    You'll notice that all the exchanges in the document shares the same
    routing key pattern. This makes it very easy to bind to all messages
    about a certain kind tasks.

    **Task specific routes**, a task can define a task specific route using
    the `task.routes` property. See task creation documentation for details
    on permissions required to provide task specific routes. If a task has
    the entry `'notify.by-email'` in as task specific route defined in
    `task.routes` all messages about this task will be CC'ed with the
    routing-key `'route.notify.by-email'`.

    These routes will always be prefixed `route.`, so that cannot interfere
    with the _primary_ routing key as documented here. Notice that the
    _primary_ routing key is always prefixed `primary.`. This is ensured
    in the routing key reference, so API clients will do this automatically.

    Please, note that the way RabbitMQ works, the message will only arrive
    in your queue once, even though you may have bound to the exchange with
    multiple routing key patterns that matches more of the CC'ed routing
    routing keys.

    **Delivery guarantees**, most operations on the queue are idempotent,
    which means that if repeated with the same arguments then the requests
    will ensure completion of the operation and return the same response.
    This is useful if the server crashes or the TCP connection breaks, but
    when re-executing an idempotent operation, the queue will also resend
    any related AMQP messages. Hence, messages may be repeated.

    This shouldn't be much of a problem, as the best you can achieve using
    confirm messages with AMQP is at-least-once delivery semantics. Hence,
    this only prevents you from obtaining at-most-once delivery semantics.

    **Remark**, some message generated by timeouts maybe dropped if the
    server crashes at wrong time. Ideally, we'll address this in the
    future. For now we suggest you ignore this corner case, and notify us
    if this corner case is of concern to you.

        Task Defined Messages

        When a task is created or just defined a message is posted to this
        exchange.

        This message exchange is mainly useful when tasks are scheduled by a
        scheduler that uses `defineTask` as this does not make the task
        `pending`. Thus, no `taskPending` message is published.
        Please, note that messages are also published on this exchange if defined
        using `createTask`.

        This exchange outputs: ``v1/task-defined-message.json#``This exchange takes the following keys:

         * routingKeyKind: Identifier for the routing-key kind. This is always `'primary'` for the formalized routing key. (required)

         * taskId: `taskId` for the task this message concerns (required)

         * runId: `runId` of latest run for the task, `_` if no run is exists for the task.

        the same payload again in-order to continue uploading the artifact.

        However, in most cases (especially for small artifacts) it's very
        reasonable assume the artifact will be available within a few minutes.
