class AwsProvisioner(BaseClient):
    """
    The AWS Provisioner is responsible for provisioning instances on EC2 for use in
    Taskcluster.  The provisioner maintains a set of worker configurations which
    can be managed with an API that is typically available at
    aws-provisioner.taskcluster.net/v1.  This API can also perform basic instance
    management tasks in addition to maintaining the internal state of worker type
    configuration information.

    The Provisioner runs at a configurable interval.  Each iteration of the
    provisioner fetches a current copy the state that the AWS EC2 api reports.  In
    each iteration, we ask the Queue how many tasks are pending for that worker
    type.  Based on the number of tasks pending and the scaling ratio, we may
    submit requests for new instances.  We use pricing information, capacity and
    utility factor information to decide which instance type in which region would
    be the optimal configuration.

    Each EC2 instance type will declare a capacity and utility factor.  Capacity is
    the number of tasks that a given machine is capable of running concurrently.
    Utility factor is a relative measure of performance between two instance types.
    We multiply the utility factor by the spot price to compare instance types and
    regions when making the bidding choices.

    When a new EC2 instance is instantiated, its user data contains a token in
    `securityToken` that can be used with the `getSecret` method to retrieve
    the worker's credentials and any needed passwords or other restricted
    information.  The worker is responsible for deleting the secret after
    retrieving it, to prevent dissemination of the secret to other proceses
    which can read the instance user data.

        Create new Worker Type

        Create a worker type.  A worker type contains all the configuration
        needed for the provisioner to manage the instances.  Each worker type
        knows which regions and which instance types are allowed for that
        worker type.  Remember that Capacity is the number of concurrent tasks
        that can be run on a given EC2 resource and that Utility is the relative
        performance rate between different instance types.  There is no way to
        configure different regions to have different sets of instance types
        so ensure that all instance types are available in all regions.
        This function is idempotent.

        Once a worker type is in the provisioner, a back ground process will
        begin creating instances for it based on its capacity bounds and its
        pending task count from the Queue.  It is the worker's responsibility
        to shut itself down.  The provisioner has a limit (currently 96hours)
        for all instances to prevent zombie instances from running indefinitely.

        The provisioner will ensure that all instances created are tagged with
        aws resource tags containing the provisioner id and the worker type.

        If provided, the secrets in the global, region and instance type sections
        are available using the secrets api.  If specified, the scopes provided
        will be used to generate a set of temporary credentials available with
        the other secrets.
