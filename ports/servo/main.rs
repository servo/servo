//! The `servo` test application.

//! Creates a `Servo` instance with a simple implementation of
//! the compositor's `WindowMethods` to create a working web browser.
//!
//! This browser's implementation of `WindowMethods` is built on top
//! of [glutin], the cross-platform OpenGL utility and windowing
//! library.
//!
//! For the engine itself look next door in `components/servo/lib.rs`.
