# If you need to temporarily test Servo with a local fork of some upstream
# crate, add that here. Use the form:
#
#     <crate> = { path = "/path/to/local/checkout" }
#
# Or for a git dependency:
#
#     [patch."https://github.com/servo/<repository>"]
#     <crate> = { path = "/path/to/local/checkout" }

# Those are here to dedupe winapi since mio is still using winapi 0.2.
