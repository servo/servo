//! A windowing implementation using shared OpenGL textures.
///
/// In this setup, Servo renders to an OpenGL texture and uses IPC to share that texture with
/// another application. It also uses IPC to handle events.
///
/// This is designed for sandboxing scenarios which the OpenGL graphics driver is either sandboxed
/// along with the Servo process or trusted. If the OpenGL driver itself is untrusted, then this
/// windowing implementation is not appropriate.
