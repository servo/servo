//! A generic, safe mechnanism by which DOM objects can be pinned and transferred
//! between tasks (or intra-task for asynchronous events). Akin to Gecko's
//! nsMainThreadPtrHandle, this uses thread-safe reference counting and ensures
//! that the actual SpiderMonkey GC integration occurs on the script task via
//! message passing. Ownership of a `Trusted<T>` object means the DOM object of
//! type T to which it points remains alive. Any other behaviour is undefined.
//! To guarantee the lifetime of a DOM object when performing asynchronous operations,
//! obtain a `Trusted<T>` from that object and pass it along with each operation.
//! A usable pointer to the original DOM object can be obtained on the script task
//! from a `Trusted<T>` via the `to_temporary` method.
//!
//! The implementation of Trusted<T> is as follows:
//! A hashtable resides in the script task, keyed on the pointer to the Rust DOM object.
//! The values in this hashtable are atomic reference counts. When a Trusted<T> object is
//! created or cloned, this count is increased. When a Trusted<T> is dropped, the count
//! decreases. If the count hits zero, a message is dispatched to the script task to remove
//! the entry from the hashmap if the count is still zero. The JS reflector for the DOM object
//! is rooted when a hashmap entry is first created, and unrooted when the hashmap entry
//! is removed.
