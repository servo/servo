//! A generic, safe mechanism by which DOM objects can be pinned and transferred
//! between threads (or intra-thread for asynchronous events). Akin to Gecko's
//! nsMainThreadPtrHandle, this uses thread-safe reference counting and ensures
//! that the actual SpiderMonkey GC integration occurs on the script thread via
//! weak refcounts. Ownership of a `Trusted<T>` object means the DOM object of
//! type T to which it points remains alive. Any other behaviour is undefined.
//! To guarantee the lifetime of a DOM object when performing asynchronous operations,
//! obtain a `Trusted<T>` from that object and pass it along with each operation.
//! A usable pointer to the original DOM object can be obtained on the script thread
//! from a `Trusted<T>` via the `to_temporary` method.
//!
//! The implementation of `Trusted<T>` is as follows:
//! The `Trusted<T>` object contains an atomic reference counted pointer to the Rust DOM object.
//! A hashtable resides in the script thread, keyed on the pointer.
//! The values in this hashtable are weak reference counts. When a `Trusted<T>` object is
//! created or cloned, the reference count is increased. When a `Trusted<T>` is dropped, the count
//! decreases. If the count hits zero, the weak reference is emptied, and is removed from
//! its hash table during the next GC. During GC, the entries of the hash table are counted
//! as JS roots.
