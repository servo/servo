# DOM Bindings Configuration.
#
# The WebIDL interfaces are defined in dom/webidls. For each such interface,
# there is a corresponding entry in the configuration table below.
# The configuration table maps each interface name to a |descriptor|.
#
# Valid fields for all descriptors:
#   * outerObjectHook: string to use in place of default value for outerObject and thisObject
#                      JS class hooks

#FIXME(jdm): This should be 'register': False, but then we don't generate enum types
'TestBinding': {},

'URL': {
    'weakReferenceable': True,
