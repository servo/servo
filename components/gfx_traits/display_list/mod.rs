//! Servo heavily uses display lists, which are retained-mode lists of painting commands to
//! perform. Using a list instead of painting elements in immediate mode allows transforms, hit
//! testing, and invalidation to be performed using the same primitives as painting. It also allows
//! Servo to aggressively cull invisible and out-of-bounds painting elements, to reduce overdraw.
//! Finally, display lists allow tiles to be farmed out onto multiple CPUs and painted in parallel
//! (although this benefit does not apply to GPU-based painting).
//!
//! Display items describe relatively high-level drawing operations (for example, entire borders
//! and shadows instead of lines and blur operations), to reduce the amount of allocation required.
//! They are therefore not exactly analogous to constructs like Skia pictures, which consist of
//! low-level drawing primitives.
