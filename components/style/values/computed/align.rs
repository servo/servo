/// special legacy keyword without destroying style sharing.
///
/// In particular, `justify-items` is a reset property, so we ought to be able
/// to share its computed representation across elements as long as they match
/// the same rules. Except that it's not true if the specified value for
/// `justify-items` is `legacy` and the computed value of the parent has the
/// `legacy` modifier.

/// So instead of computing `legacy` "normally" looking at get_parent_position(),
/// marking it as uncacheable, we carry the specified value around and handle
/// the special case in `StyleAdjuster` instead, only when the result of the
/// computation would vary.
///
/// Note that we also need to special-case this property in matching.rs, in
/// order to properly handle changes to the legacy keyword... This all kinda
/// sucks :(.
