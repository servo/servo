//! Animation implementation for various grid-related types.

// Note: we can implement Animate on their generic types directly, but in this case we need to
// make sure two trait bounds, L: Clone and I: PartialEq, are satisfied on almost all the
// grid-related types and their other trait implementations because Animate needs them. So in
// order to avoid adding these two trait bounds (or maybe more..) everywhere, we implement
// Animate for the computed types, instead of the generic types.
