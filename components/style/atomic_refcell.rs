/// RwLock is traditionally considered to be the |Sync| analogue of RefCell.
/// However, for consumers that can guarantee that they will never mutably
/// borrow the contents concurrently with immutable borrows, an RwLock feels
/// like overkill.
///
/// The RwLock in the standard library is indeed heavyweight, since it heap-
/// allocates an OS-specific primitive and delegates operations to it. However,
/// parking_lot provides a pure-rust implementation of the standard
/// synchronization primitives, with uncontended borrows compiling down to a
/// single atomic operation. This is exactly how we would build an atomic
/// RefCell, so we newtype it with some API sugar.
