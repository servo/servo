//! Implements parallel traversal over the DOM tree.
//!
//! This traversal is based on Rayon, and therefore its safety is largely
//! verified by the type system.
//!
//! The primary trickiness and fine print for the above relates to the
//! thread safety of the DOM nodes themselves. Accessing a DOM element
//! concurrently on multiple threads is actually mostly "safe", since all
//! the mutable state is protected by an AtomicRefCell, and so we'll
//! generally panic if something goes wrong. Still, we try to to enforce our
//! thread invariants at compile time whenever possible. As such, TNode and
//! TElement are not Send, so ordinary style system code cannot accidentally
//! share them with other threads. In the parallel traversal, we explicitly
//! invoke |unsafe { SendNode::new(n) }| to put nodes in containers that may
//! be sent to other threads. This occurs in only a handful of places and is
//! easy to grep for. At the time of this writing, there is no other unsafe
//! code in the parallel traversal.
