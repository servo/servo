# This crate effectively does nothing except if the `known_system_malloc`
# feature is specified.
#
# In that case, we actually call the system malloc functions to reserve space,
# otherwise we just let rust do its thing (aborting on OOM).
#
# This is effectively a stop-gap measure until we can do this properly in
# stable rust.
