//! Servo API unit tests.
//!
//! Since all Servo tests must run serially on the same thread, it is important
//! that tests never panic. In order to ensure this, use `anyhow::ensure!` instead
//! of `assert!` for test assertions. `ensure!` will produce a `Result::Err` in
//! place of panicking.

    // The drop implementation of `Servo` will trigger the shutdown processs and also spin the
    // event loop until shutdown is complete.
