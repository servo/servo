//! A (mostly) lock-free concurrent work-stealing deque
//!
//! This module contains an implementation of the Chase-Lev work stealing deque
//! described in "Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing Deque". The implementation is
//! heavily based on the pseudocode found in the paper.
//!
//! This implementation does not want to have the restriction of a garbage
//! collector for reclamation of buffers, and instead it uses a shared pool of
//! buffers. This shared pool is required for correctness in this
//! implementation.
//!
//! The only lock-synchronized portions of this deque are the buffer allocation
//! and deallocation portions. Otherwise all operations are lock-free.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//!     use util::deque::BufferPool;
//!
//!     let mut pool = BufferPool::new();
//!     let (mut worker, mut stealer) = pool.deque();
//!
//!     // Only the worker may push/pop
//!     worker.push(1i);
//!     worker.pop();
//!
//!     // Stealers take data from the other end of the deque
//!     worker.push(1i);
//!     stealer.steal();
//!
//!     // Stealers can be cloned to have many stealers stealing in parallel
//!     worker.push(1i);
//!     let mut stealer2 = stealer.clone();
//!     stealer2.steal();

// NB: the "buffer pool" strategy is not done for speed, but rather for
//     correctness. For more info, see the comment on `swap_buffer`

// FIXME: all atomic operations in this module use a SeqCst ordering. That is
//      probably overkill
