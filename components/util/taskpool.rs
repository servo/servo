//! A load-balancing task pool.
//!
//! This differs in implementation from std::sync::TaskPool in that each job is
//! up for grabs by any of the child tasks in the pool.
//!

//
// This is based on the cargo task pool.
// https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/util/pool.rs
//
// The only difference is that a normal channel is used instead of a sync_channel.
