# Disable doctests, because of linking issues with rustdoc. rustdoc compiles
# documentation tests with prefer-dynamic. This causes issues because rustc
# looks for -lazure, which does not exist (rust-azure is a dependency of
# rust-layers). This crate only has one documentation example anyway and it's
# imported from the rust-lang codebase.
# See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21246

[features]

# This feature allows us to avoid depending on various things we don't need for
# GeckoLib builds. Conceptually, it would make more sense to have a "geckolib"
# feature, but Cargo is generally set up for features to add dependencies, not
# remove them. So we do it this way, and request that all non-GeckoLib builds
# set this feature.
