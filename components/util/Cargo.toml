# This feature allows us to avoid depending on various things we don't need for
# GeckoLib builds. Conceptually, it would make more sense to have a "geckolib"
# feature, but Cargo is generally set up for features to add dependencies, not
# remove them. So we do it this way, and request that all non-GeckoLib builds
# set this feature.
