    <p>
      Servoâ€™s mission is to provide an independent, modular, embeddable web engine, which allows developers to deliver content and applications using web standards.
    </p>
    <p>
    Servo is written in Rust, and shares code with Mozilla Firefox and the wider Rust ecosystem. Since its creation in 2012, Servo has contributed to W3C/WHATWG web standards by reporting specification issues and submitting new cross-browser automated tests, and core team members have co-edited new standards that have been adopted by other browsers. As a result, the Servo project helps drive the entire web platform forward while building on a platform of reusable, modular technologies that implement web standards.
