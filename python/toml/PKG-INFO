        QUICK GUIDE
        -----------
        
        ``pip install toml``
        
        toml.loads --- takes a string to be parsed as toml and returns the corresponding dictionary
        
        toml.dumps --- takes a dictionary and returns a string which is the contents of the corresponding toml file.
        
        
        There are other functions which I use to dump and load various fragments of toml but dumps and loads will cover most usage.
        
        Example usage:
        
        .. code:: python
        
          import toml
        
          with open("conf.toml") as conffile:
              config = toml.loads(conffile.read())
          # do stuff with config here
          . . .
