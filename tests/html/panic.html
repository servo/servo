<!-- To exercise these tests, set the `dom.testbinding.enabled` to true.
     It is expected that the browser will not abort due to failed JS engine assertions. -->

<!-- Straightforward test - invoking a panic from a toplevel script execution -->
<script>
(new TestBinding()).panic();
</script>

<!-- invoking a panic from an event handler which is invoked by native code -->
<!--<iframe src="data:,hi there" onload="(new TestBinding()).panic()"></iframe>-->

<!-- invoking a panic from an event handler which is invoked by script -->
<!--<div onclick="(new TestBinding()).panic()"></div>
<script>
document.querySelector('div').click();
