<!-- NOTE: Using setTimeout to wait for high-quality downscaled version of
     image to be ready, because there's nothing better we can do. If we fix
     Bug 1006883, we can do away with this setTimeout.

     For now, the setTimeout is just here to increase the likelihood that we
     actually test the high-quality downscaled version of the image. If the
     setTimeout happens to fire before the high-quality downscaled rendering is
     ready, then this the test will pass without testing what it's trying to
     test, which is fine as long as that's rare.  -->
