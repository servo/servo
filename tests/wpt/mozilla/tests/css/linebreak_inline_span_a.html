    The <span>most terrifying</span> fact about the universe <span>is not that
    it is hostile but that it is indifferent;</span> but if we can come to terms
    with this indifference and accept the<span> challenges</span> of <span>life
    <span>within</span></span> the boundaries of death - <span>however</span>
    mutable man may be able to make them - our existence as a species can have
    genuine meaning and fulfillment. However vast the darkness, we must supply
    our own light.
