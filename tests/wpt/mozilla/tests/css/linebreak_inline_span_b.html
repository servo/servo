    The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but
    that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference
    and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death - however
    mutable man may be able to make them - our existence as a species can have
    genuine meaning and fulfillment. However vast the darkness, we must supply
    our own light.
