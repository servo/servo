    Normally in quirks, only text and uncollapsible white space in inline boxes
    adds the inline box line height to the line. A forced line break is a kind of
    uncollapsible white space, so it should add line height to the line box.

    We implement <br> in Servo with `white-space: pre-line`, but <br> doesn't act
    like a preserved line break. It only adds its line height to the line if its
    on an empty line.

    This behavior doesn't seem to be specified, so is part of the "magic" behavior
    of <br> elements.

<style>
    span {
        display: inline-block;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        background: green;
        color: transparent;
    }
</style>
<body>
    <div style="width: 100px; border: solid; line-height: 50px;">
        <span>A</span>
        <!-- The first <br> ends the line and the second <br> adds 50px
            of block size, because it inherits `line-height` from the
            parent <div> -->
        <br>
        <br>
        <span>A</span>
    </div>
