<meta name="assert" content="This tests that we get no crash if we put an extremely tall inline-block inside an extremely tall multicol container. Engines typically have some maximum limit for how large values they can represent. If the value is large enough to become 'infinity', the engine should still not crash">
<!-- Explanation for the CSS values specified below: This test was written for
     the Chromium Blink engine, which uses a fixed-point 32 bit integer. In this
     example, the value will be too large, so it will be clamped to the maximum
     value (about 2^25 px). However, there's a a further complication in that
     CSS length values in Blink are transported via a 32bit float, so precision
     will be a few pixels off. So even if 1234567890px is way more than Blink
     can handle, it will be truncated to a bit less than the maximum value
     (about 2^25). We want the multicol container to be as tall as it can
     possibly get, so we put it inside a 1234567890px tall container, and
     specify the height of the child multicol container to be 200% to ensure
     this. We also use a percentage to specify the height of the child inside
     the multicol container, for the same reason. -->
