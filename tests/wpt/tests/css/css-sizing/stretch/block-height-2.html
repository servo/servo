Chrome fails the following test, which is a variation of example 9 in the spec. Safari passes.

From https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-4/#stretch-fit-sizing, height:stretch for blocks behaves as
"""
100% but applying the resulting size to its margin box instead of the box indicated by box-sizing. For this purpose, auto margins are treated as zero, and furthermore, for block-level boxes in particular, if its block-start/block-end margin would be adjoining to its parent’s block-start/block-end margin if its parent’s sizing properties all had their initial values, then ***its block-start/block-end margin is treated as zero.***
"""

So the spec demands that the child has 0px margins and as a corollary, has 300px inner and outer height.

But Blink gives it an inner height of 200px and margins as specified (25px/75px).
