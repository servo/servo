    <title>CSS Test (Transforms): Fixed Background (will-change: transform)</title>

    <meta name="assert" content='"Fixed backgrounds on the root element are
    affected by any transform specified for that element. For all other
    elements that are effected by a transform (i.e. have a transform applied
    to them, or to any of their ancestor elements), a value of fixed for the
    background-attachment property is treated as if it had a value of scroll."
    This tests that adding will-change: transform to an element with a fixed
    background doesn&apos;t change rendering from scroll background.'>
