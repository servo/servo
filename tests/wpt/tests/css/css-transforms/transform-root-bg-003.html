    <meta name="assert" content="This is the same as
    transform-root-bg-001.html, except that it uses scale(0.5) instead of
    scale(-1).  It also specifies a transform-origin, because the default of
    50% 50% wouldn't work well with the way the reference image is constructed.">

         * The transform-origin here has to fall between two triangles, i.e.,
         * at a multiple of 100px.  Otherwise after the transform, the shrunken
         * images won't line up with the left edge of the body, and it won't
         * match the ref (since the background here is positioned at the left).
         * We deliberately make it an odd multiple of the number of images so
         * it catches an IE bug; it shouldn't matter per spec
