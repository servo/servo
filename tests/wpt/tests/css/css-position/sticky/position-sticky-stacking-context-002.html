  <meta name="assert" content="This test checks that an element with 'position: sticky' creates a stacking context. In this test, the first 2 divs have the same 'auto' z-index value but since div#sticky is last in document tree order, then it must overlap div#overlapped-red. The final div#overlap-bottom-half-of-sticky exists to make sure that the div#sticky is squeezed, is 'sandwiched' between the other 2.">

  <style>
  div
    {
      height: 100px;
      width: 100px;
    }

  div#overlapped-red
    {
      background-color: red;
      position: absolute;
    }

  div#sticky
    {
      background: linear-gradient(to bottom, green 51%, red 49%);
      position: sticky;
    }

  div#overlap-bottom-half-of-sticky
    {
      background-color: green;
      bottom: 50px;
      height: 50px;
      position: relative;
    }
  </style>

  <p>Test passes if there is a filled green square and <strong>no red</strong>.

  <div id="overlapped-red"></div>

  <div id="sticky"></div>

  <div id="overlap-bottom-half-of-sticky"></div>
