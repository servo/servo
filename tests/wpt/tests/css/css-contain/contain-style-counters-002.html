  <meta content="This test checks that when an element has 'contain: style', then counters which may be affecting its subtree are reset to 0 for such scope. In this test, the div#test does not generate a principal box because of 'display: contents'. Despite that particular condition, 'contain: style' will have an effect on div#test." name="assert">

    This creates a new counter identified as "counter-of-span"

    arbitrary number).

    Other types of containment (size, layout, paint) have no
    effect on box that do not generate a principal box which
    is the case here with div#test because of 'display: contents'.
    But in this test, 'contain: style' will apply and will
    have a rendering effect on the counter.

    /*
    This increments the counter identified as "counter-of-span"
