CSS Global Support Directory
============================

This directory contains common support files (such as images and external
style sheets). These are sync'ed into the support directories of all our
test suites. If you have test-suite-specific support files, please add
them to the appropriate test-suite-specific support/ directory.

If you add to a support/ directory, please run the tools/supportprop.py
script from the top of the repository to cascade support files into the
lower-level support directories.
