# cap-x-height.ttf

This is the same as `Ahem.ttf`, with following changes:
* OS/2.sCapHeight is changed from 800 to 600.
* OS/2.sxHeight is changed from 800 to 200.
* The top of the 'x' glyph is modified to match the x-height, because some
  platforms compute the x-height from the glyph bounding box.

These changes were done by using the FontForge, an open source font editor.
