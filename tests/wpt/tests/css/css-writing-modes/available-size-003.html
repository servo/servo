<meta name="assert" content="When an orthogonal flow's parent doesn't have a definite block size and the nearest ancestor scroller does have a fixed height, use that, making sure you stick with the content height.">
<style>
#scroller {
  font-family: monospace; /* to be able to reliably measure things in ch*/
  font-size: 20px;
  height: 8ch;
  width: 300px; /* Shrinkwrapping this div is not what we're interested in testing here, so give it a width. See nested-orthogonal-001.html for that. */
  overflow: hidden;
  color: transparent;
  position: relative; /* to act as a container of #red */
  padding: 1ch 0;
}

#parent { padding-bottom: 2ch; } /* so that the content height of the parent and of the fixed size scrolling ancestor are different */
#ortho { writing-mode: vertical-rl; }

span {
  background: green;
  display: inline-block; /* This should not change it's size or position, but makes the size of the background predictable*/
}

#red { /* Not necessary when when comparing to the reference, but makes human judgement easier */
  position: absolute;
  background: red;

<p>Test passes if there is a <strong>green rectangle</strong> below and <strong>no red</strong>.

    <!-- If this div take its height from the height of its scrollable ancestor,
         it should wrap just right for the green 0 to overlap with the red one. -->
