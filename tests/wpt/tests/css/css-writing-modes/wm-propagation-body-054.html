  Issue 3066: [css-writing-modes] Does vertical writing mode of an HTML body
  element cause an orthogonal flow?

  <meta name="assert" content="This test checks that when the root element has a &lt;body&gt; child element, then the principal writing mode is instead taken from the values of writing-mode and direction on the first such child element instead of taken from the root element. Also, a small script in this test verifies that the computed value of 'writing-mode' of the root element itself is not affected by such propagation. Finally, in order to make sure that the principal writing mode is indeed 'vertical-lr', the test checks that a simple text is affected by 'text-orientation: upright' since 'text-orientation: upright' should have a rendering effect on it.">
