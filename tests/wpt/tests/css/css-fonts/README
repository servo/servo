These are a simple set of reftests for testing CSS 2.1 Fonts.  They require the fonts in the fonts subdirectory to be installed on the machine where the test is run.

To run the tests:

1. Load test-prerequisites.xht to verify fonts have been installed.

2. Run through the tests in fontreftest.list.  '==' indicates that the two pages should render identically, != that they should not.

The fonts are modified versions of Gentium Basic, licensed by SIL under the Open Font License which allows modifications as long as the terms of the license are met.

The original fonts were used to create the family 'CSSTest Basic', this family has four faces and can be used for testing bold / italics.  A subsetted version of this font with only glyphs for basic ASCII characters 'CSSTest ASCII'.  This was used to make the other variations.  Most of the modications are to the name table and character maps, for the most part glyphs were not modified.
