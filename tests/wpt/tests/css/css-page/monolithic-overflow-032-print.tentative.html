<!-- It's not obvious that the expected behavior here is correct, but Blink and
     Gecko agree on it. Essentially, we expect that when the tall monolithic
     content has been fully placed (see the third page), and there's more
     content after it, a new fragment starts right after the fragment with tall
     monolithic content. This means that it would appear that there are two
     fragments from the same node on the same page, but this is not really the
     case, since the first fragment is just a huge fragment that has run all the
     way since the first page. -->
