<p>The following two lines should be the same:</p>
<!-- As rb creates counter only on ::before, the first span with class "use" -->
<!-- inside the "rb" will inherit its counter from second "reset" as span "rb" -->
<!-- will inherit it from previous sibling which is second "reset" -->

  <span class="reset"></span>

  <span class="rb">
