<!--

"
 Then, if the min-content contribution of any grid item has changed based on
 the row sizes and alignment calculated in step 2, re-resolve the sizes of the
 grid columns with the new min-content and max-content contributions (once
 only).
"

In this testcase initially the row size is indefinite, then resolves to 100px.
Using this information we re-resolve the columns, resulting in 100px for the
first column.
