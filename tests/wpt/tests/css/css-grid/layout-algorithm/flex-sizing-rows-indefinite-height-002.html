.grid {
  display: grid;
  width: 100px;
  background: red;
}
.item {
  grid-row: 2 / span 1;
  background: green;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;

}

<!--
  Flexible row track sizes are resolved in two passes:

  The first pass:
   - The only grid item has a max-content height of 100px, which is also the
     hypothetical fr size.
   - Initially, each flexible track (0.4fr) is given a hypothetical size of
     100px * 0.4 = 40px.
   - This makes the grid container's height 40px * 2 = 80px in this pass.

  The second pass:
   - With the grid container's height now became fixed at 80px, the available
     grid space is known.
   - Per https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-2/#algo-find-fr-size
     the hypothetical fr size is 80px * max(0.4 * 2 , 1.0) = 80px.
   - In this pass, each 0.4fr row track resolves to 80px * 0.4 = 32px in height.
