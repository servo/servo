  <style>
  div
    {
      color: red;
      font-size: 300%;
    }

  div::selection
    {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>

  <p>Instructions: Select a few or all characters from the words "Text sample" using a variety of methods:

  <ul>
    <li>Select by dragging (leftwardedly or rightwardedly) the mouse across the characters.
    <li>Select by using shift + keyboard arrows when keyboard navigation / caret browsing is enabled.
    <li>Double click a word to select it.
    <li>Triple click the text to select it.
  </ul>

  <p>Test passes if, in every case, the selected characters become green <em>and</em> if there is no background color for the characters selection.

  <div>Text sample</div>
