<title>CSS Overflow: soft wrap opportunities created by overflow-wrap are ignored for inserting block-ellipsis</title>

<meta name="assert" content="The block-ellipsis is placed after the last soft wrap opportunity in the line box that fits the ellipsis. `overflow-wrap: anywhere`, however, does not count as creating soft wrap opportunities. Therefore, if a line with the ellipsis has no breakpoints that would prevent it from overflowing, it gets entirely displaced by the ellipsis.">

  uncharacteristically  <!-- the ellipsis would cause this line to overflow -->
