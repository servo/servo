<title>CSS Overflow: `line-clamp` and text-wrap: balance, height based, clamp caused by balance</title>

<meta name="assert" content="Checks that balancing after claming can cause clamping when working with height based clamping, even if there was no clamp point prior to balancing.">
<style>
.clamp {
  line-clamp: auto;
  font-family: monospace;
  width: 9.1ch; /* the extra .1 is just a bit of extra wiggle room, in case things aren't sized perfectly. */
  line-height: 1;
  max-height: 3lh;
  text-wrap: balance;
}
span { font-size: 2em; }
</style>
<p>Test passes if you see numbers up to 3 (and no further) below.

<div class="clamp">
1 2 <span>3</span> <span>4</span> 5 6
</div>

<!--
    Initially, we are limited to 3lh worth of content,
    which means we can fit all the content:
    first one line with some big numbers, and a second one with only small ones.
    Then, when balancing, we move "4" to the second line,
    which makes it no longer fit,
    so that line gets clamped away.
