<meta name="assert" content="The block-ellipsis displaces entire sequences of nowrap content if it needs to make room, regardless of internal wrap opportunities.">

.clamp {
  line-clamp: 2;
  width: 63.1ch;
  border: 1px solid black;
  font-family: monospace;
}
span {
  white-space: nowrap;
}
</style>
<p>Test passes if there are two lines below, and if there is an ellipsis (“…”) after the word “walked” at the end of the second line.

<div class="clamp">This time, Mark, who had always been the center of attention in
any social gathering, walked <span>into the room uncharacteristically</span>
quietly, barely speaking as he settled into a chair.
When asked, he said that he was fine, when he wasn't really fine.</div>
