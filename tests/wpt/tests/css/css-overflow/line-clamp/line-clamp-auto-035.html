<meta name="assert" content="With `line-clamp: auto`, the clamp point is set at the furthermost possible clamp point where the box doesn't go past the max-height. If there is an inner box with a set height, and it doesn't overflow, every clamp point inside it would increase the line-clamp container's block size by the same amount as the clamp point after the box.">
