This test suite is created as part of Chrome's NG table rewrite in 2020.
TablesNG: https://crbug.com/958381

Many parts of table layout algorithm have been left unspecified by the
existing specification:
https://www.w3.org/TR/css-tables-3/

These tests are an attempt to exaustively test all parts of the
algorithm. When specification did not specify the algorithm,
the proposed algorithm is described in the tests.

Our goal is that these tests will guide creation of a more complete
table standard.
