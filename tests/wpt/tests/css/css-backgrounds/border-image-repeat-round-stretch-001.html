  <meta content="This test checks that the process of repeating the tile when 'border-image-repeat' is 'round stretch'. Thanks to a specially crafted rectangular border-image, we check how the sliced border-image is, in the first-subtest, rescaled down horizontally (top and bottom sides), and is, in the second-subtest, rescaled up horizontally (top and bottom sides). In both subtests, the border-image in the vertical axis (left and right sides) are stretched." name="assert">

  'round'
  The image is tiled (repeated) to fill the area. If it does not
  fill the area with a whole number of tiles, the image is rescaled
  so that it does.

  'stretch'
  The image is stretched to fill the area.

      the vertical scaling and tiling of the left, middle and right parts

      /*
      96px divided by 64px == 1.5 which is rounded up to 2.
      So, the image should be 96px divided by 2 == 48px
      wide. That means that the top and bottom bicolor
      (yellow and purple) images should be 48px wide,
      therefore rescaled down, from sliced 64px to 48px.

      The left and right sides should be stretched from
      sliced 64px to 192px (3 times).

      80px divided by 64px == 1.25 which is rounded down to 1.
      So, each image should be 80px divided by 1 == 80px
      wide. That means that the top and bottom bicolor
      (yellow and purple) images should be 80px wide
      therefore rescaled up, from sliced 64px to 80px.

      The left and right sides should be stretched from
