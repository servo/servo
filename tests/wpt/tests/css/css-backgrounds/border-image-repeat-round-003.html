  <meta content="This test checks that the process of repeating the tile when 'border-image-repeat' is 'round'. In this test, we check with a specially crafted rectangular border-image how the sliced border-image is, in the first-subtest, rescaled down in the 4 sides, is, in the second-subtest, rescaled up in the 4 sides and, finally, is, in the third-subtest, rescaled up in the left and right sides while being rescaled down in the top and bottom sides." name="assert">

  'round'
  The image is tiled (repeated) to fill the area. If it does not
  fill the area with a whole number of tiles, the image is rescaled
  so that it does.

      /*
      96px divided by 64px == 1.5 which is rounded up to 2.
      So, each image should be 96px divided by 2 == 48px
      wide or tall. That means that the top and bottom
      bicolor (yellow and purple) images should be 48px wide
      and the left and right bicolor (orange and blue)
      images should be 48px tall.
      So, in this first-subtest, the 4 side border-image is
      rescaled down, from sliced 64px to 48px.
      */
    }

  div#second-subtest
    {
      height: 80px;
      width: 80px;
      /*
      80px divided by 64px == 1.25 which is rounded down to 1.
      So, each image should be 80px divided by 1 == 80px
      wide or tall. That means that the top and bottom
      bicolor (yellow and purple) images should be 80px wide
      and the left and right bicolor (orange and blue)
      images should be 80px tall.
      So, in this second-subtest, the 4 side border-image are
      rescaled up, from sliced 64px to 80px.

  div#third-subtest
    {
      margin-top: 1em;

      height: 144px;
      width: 168px;
      /*
      168px divided by 64px == 2.625 which is rounded up to 3.
      So, each image should be 168px divided by 3 == 56px
      wide. That means that the top and bottom
      bicolor (yellow and purple) images should be 56px wide.
      144px divided by 64px == 2.25 which is rounded down to 2.
      So, each image should be 144px divided by 2 == 72px
      tall. That means that the left and right
      bicolor (orange and blue) images should be 72px tall.
      So, in this third-subtest, the 2 top and bottom sides
      border-image are rescaled down, from sliced 64px to
      56px while the 2 left and right sides border-image are
      rescaled up, from sliced 64px to 72px.
