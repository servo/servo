  <meta content="This test checks that the process of repeating the tile when 'border-image-repeat' is 'space'. The testing div is wide enough and tall enough to have 2 complete border-image on each of the 4 sides. 96px will become the extra space which must be distributed around the 2 tiles." name="assert">

  'space'
    The image is tiled (repeated) to fill the area. If it does
    not fill the area with a whole number of tiles, the extra
    space is distributed around the tiles.

    /*

      296
    -
      200
    ======
       96

     and since there is 3 spaces created, we divide
     the remaining by 3 giving us exactly 32px between and around
     each pair of (gray, purple, orange and blue) squares
