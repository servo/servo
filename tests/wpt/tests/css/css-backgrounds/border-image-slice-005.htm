                transparent areas of 18px wide.
                So: 5 times 18px == 90px which is 30% of 300px

                The bottom side uses 3 blue borders of 4px wide interleaved with 2
                transparent areas of 12px wide.
                So: 5 times 12px == 60px which is 20% of 300px

                The left side uses 3 blue borders of 6px wide interleaved with 2
                transparent areas of 6px wide.
