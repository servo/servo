  <meta content="Box shadows do not affect layout. Box shadows take up no space. Box shadows do not affect or influence normal flow of boxes. Therefore, box shadows can 'collide' with other boxes and can overlap other boxes (inline box or line box) or be overlapped by other boxes. In this test, the text ('PNG') follows a right outer box shadow and therefore overlaps such shadow." name="assert">

    {
      background-color: yellow;
      color: green;
      float: left;
      font-family: Ahem;

    /*

    omitted colors default to the value of the color property.

    1st <length>
    Specifies the horizontal offset of the shadow. A positive value
    draws a shadow that is offset to the right of the box, a negative
    length to the left.

    2nd <length>
    Specifies the vertical offset of the shadow. A positive value
    offsets the shadow down, a negative one up.

  <p>Test passes if there is a filled green rectangle and <strong>no red</strong>.
