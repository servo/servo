  /*
    102px divided by 40px == 2.55
    Rounding of 2.55 == 3
    So, there must be at least 3 blue squares
    on each horizontal side and on each vertical side.
    102px divided by 3 == 34px
    The 6 blue squares at top and bottom edges
    will each be 34px wide by 40px tall.
    The remaining 6 blue squares at left and right edges
    will each be 40px wide by 34px tall.
