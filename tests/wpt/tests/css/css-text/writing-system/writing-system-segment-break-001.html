<meta name=assert content="If the writing system of the segment break is Chinese, Japanese, or Yi,
and the character before or after the segment break is punctuation or a symbol (Unicode general category P* or S*)
and has an East Asian Width property of A or is Emoji,
and the character on the other side of the segment break is F, W, or H, and not Hangul or Emoji,
then the segment break is removed.">
<!--
In this case, checking with “ and ” which are punctuation with East Asian Width of A,
next to Katakana letters (which are W),
while the writing system is Katakana, which is classified as Japanese,
despite a non Japanese content language (Ainu).
-->

<p>The test passes if the both lines are identical, including the spacing of the characters.
