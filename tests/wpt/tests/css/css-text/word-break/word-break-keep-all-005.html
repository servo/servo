<title>CSS-Text test: word-break keep-all does not affect U+3000</title>

<meta name=assert content="U+3000, despite being called Ideographic Space, does not belong to the ID line breaking class, or any other class whose wrapping opportunities are suppressed by word-break:keep-all. A break after it should still be allowed.">

<style>
div {
  width: 4em;
  word-break: keep-all;
}
</style>

<p>This test passes if the four characters below are arranged in a two-by-two square.
<div>字字　字字</div>
<!--
If keep-all has no effect at all, breaks are allowed everywhere,
and the result will be:
  字字　字
  字

If keep-all correctly suppresses wrapping opportunities between CJK ideographs
but also incorrectly suppresses the wrapping opportunity after U+3000,
no wrapping is possible, and the result will be:
  字字　字字
-->
