<!--
  With white-space: pre-wrap, spaces hang conditionally when they are followed
  by a forced line break. If instead they are followed by a glyph that hangs
  unconditionally, such as the ideographic space (U+3000) with
  white-space: normal, then they are not followed by a forced line break, even
  if that hanging glyph might be, and thus hang unconditionally as well.
