<style>
div {
  position: absolute;
  width: max-content;
  line-height: 1;
  color: transparent;
}
.red { background: red; }
.green { background: green; }
</style>

<p>Test passes if the shape below is green and if there is no red.
<div class=red>ああああ あ あ</div>
<div class=red>ああ<span class=green>&#x3000;&#x3000; &#x3000; &#x3000;</span><br>ああ</div>
<div class=green>ああ<br>ああ</div>
<!-- the trailing sequence of spaces must not be removed,
  so it should hide all of the first (red) div.
  However, it should hang and therefore not extend the width of its parent div,
  which would be visible as red on the second line if it were expanded.
