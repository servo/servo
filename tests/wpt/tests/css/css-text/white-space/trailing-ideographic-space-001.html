<meta name="assert" content="An ideographic space (U+3000) at the end of the line must hang.">
<style>
div {
  position: absolute;
  width: max-content;
  line-height: 1;
  color: transparent;
}
.red { background: red; }
.green { background: green; }
</style>

<p>Test passes if the shape below is green and if there is no red.

<div class=red>あああ</div>
<div class=red>ああ<span class=green>&#x3000;</span><br>ああ</div>
<div><span class=green>ああ<br>ああ</span></div>
<!-- the ideographic space must not be removed,
  so it should hide the third red あ of the first div.
  However, it should hang and therefore not extend the width of its parent div,
  which would be visible as red on the second line if it were expanded.
