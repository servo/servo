  <!--

  The sequences of white spaces following
  the "A", the "GH", the "MNO" and the
  "WXYZ" do not get collapsed. That is by
  definition of 'white-space: pre-wrap'.
  They 'hang': they behave like 'ink
  overflow' while not contributing to
  min-content sizing.

  The line feeds (&NewLine;) wrap
  content to the next line box.

  Since div#test-overlapped-red
  is floated and since its parent in
  the flow is 0-width, then the float
  is min-content sized.
  Since the widest line box
  is created by the 4th line box
  (due to "WXYZ" content), then
  div#test-overlapped-red
  must not be wider than 100px.
