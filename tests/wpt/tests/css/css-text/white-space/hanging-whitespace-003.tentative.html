<style>
  div {
    font: 25px/1 Ahem;
    width: 4ch;
    height: 4ch;
    background:
      linear-gradient(green, green) 0 1ch / 1ch 1ch no-repeat,
      linear-gradient(green, green) 0 2ch / 2ch 1ch no-repeat,
      linear-gradient(green, green) 1ch 3ch / 3ch 1ch no-repeat,
      red;

    text-align: right;
    white-space: normal;
    color: green;
  }
  .pre-wrap {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
  }
</style>

<p>Test passes if there is a filled green square and <strong>no red</strong>.</p>

<div>XXXX&#x3000;&#x3000;<span class="pre-wrap">  </span><br>
  XXX&#x3000;&#x3000;<span class="pre-wrap">  </span><br>
  XX&#x3000;&#x3000;<span class="pre-wrap">  </span><br>
  X&#x3000;&#x3000;<span class="pre-wrap">  </span></div>

<!--
  With white-space: normal, an ideographic space (U+3000) hangs unconditionally,
  as long as every glyph after it until the end of the line also hangs.
  With white-space: pre-wrap, a sequence of spaces that is followed by a forced
  line break (where the end of the block counts as a forced line break) hangs
  conditionally, meaning that the part of it that doesn't fit in the line's
  available width is the only one that hangs. (This is independent to whether it
  would overflow the block's content area.)

  Therefore, unconditional hanging glyphs before such a sequence of conditional
  hanging glyphs can only hang if the conditional sequence overflows the line's
  available width.
