# requestStorageAccessFor Tests
These tests are tentative. They are based on a proposed requestStorageAccessFor extension to the Storage Access API which can be read about [in the explainer](https://github.com/privacycg/requestStorageAccessForOrigin).

Note that the spec is in progress, and available [rendered](https://privacycg.github.io/requestStorageAccessForOrigin/) and [in bikeshed source](https://github.com/privacycg/requestStorageAccessForOrigin/blob/main/index.bs).
