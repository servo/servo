    // Force the port of the origin to be ports[https][0] (likely :8443)
    // we treat the port ports[https][1] (likely :8444) to be another origin that we fail against
    if (window.location.origin !== "https://{{host}}:{{ports[https][0]}}") {
        window.location = new URL(window.location.pathname, "https://{{host}}:{{ports[https][0]}}")
    }

<p>
    To pass, the application must show a shortcut named "pass" with a check
    mark icon. Clicking it must open this document again.
