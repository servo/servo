  Unlike *.any.js or *.worker.js tests, fetch_tests_from_worker.html/js files
  are manually written and no generated glue code are involved.

// If you want to test on SharedWorker,
// fetch_tests_from_worker(new SharedWorker("fetch_tests_from_worker.js"));

// See ServiceWorkersHandler in

// for the generated snippet used in .any.js for service workers.
// Note: when testing service workers, also add ".https." file flag in the
// main HTML's file name to run the test on HTTPS.
