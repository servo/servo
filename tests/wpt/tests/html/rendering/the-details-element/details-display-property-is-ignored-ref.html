<blockquote>
The details element is expected to render as a block box. The element's shadow
tree is expected to take the element's first summary element child, if any, and
place it in a first block box container, and then take the element's remaining
descendants, if any, and place them in a second block box container.
</blockquote>

&lt;details display:flex> should be ignored. Otherwise details would render as
something other than a block box.
