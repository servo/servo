// This test is kind of dubious. Browsers don't allow you to distinguish visited and unvisited links
// from script, for privacy reasons. So we can't really be sure that loading the iframe would make
// the link count as visited. Manually running this test turns the link purple in some browsers,
// but leaves it blue in others. Even then it's not clear whether it turned purple before or after
// the onload; this test assumes that once the iframe onload fires, it counts as visited, which
// may not be justified even in the purple-turning browsers.
//
// Still, the test doesn't really hurt. At worst it's redundant with the above.
//
// If someone comes up with a better way of testing this (i.e. something that truly guarantees that
// the link will count as "visited" for UA stylesheet purposes), then please submit a PR.
