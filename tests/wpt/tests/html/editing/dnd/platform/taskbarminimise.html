    <title>drag and drop - minimising using the taskbar</title>
  </head>
  <body>

    <p>This test is only relevant on platforms where dragging over the taskbar (or a specific button on it) will minimise all applications.</p>
    <p>Select this text. Drag the selection downwards, over a blank part of the system taskbar (or a minimise-all button if provided by the system). Hold the drag until all applications have minimised, then drag upwards over the desktop. Pass if the drag placeholder is still visible.</p>
