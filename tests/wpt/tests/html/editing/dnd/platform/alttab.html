    <p>This test is only relevant on platforms where alt+tab (or some equivalent) switches applications.</p>
    <p>Ensure that at least one other application is open. Select this text. Drag the selection downwards a little, then alt+tab (or your system's equivalent) to the other application. Pass if the drag placeholder continues to follow the mouse/pointing device. Release the drag. Pass if the drag placeholder disappears.</p>
