    <head>
        <title>unclosed canvas tag in body</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>There should be no text below this, because the text is inside a canvas element
            and the &lt;/div&gt; that's also inside the canvas element does not close an open
            element. The canvas is never closed, and the rest of the body ends up inside it.
            There's nothing special about div; we get the same results with other types of
            elements.</p>
