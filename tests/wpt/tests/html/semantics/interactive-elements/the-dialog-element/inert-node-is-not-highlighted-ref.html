<p>Test that inert nodes are not painted as being selected. The test passes if
none of the text outside the dialog is highlighted when selected.</p>

<p>Although not shown as selected, the inert nodes are in window.getSelection()
and copied to the clipboard, which is the same behavior as user-select:
none (crbug.com/147490).</p>
