<p>Bug <a href="http://webkit.org/b/106538">106538</a>: Top layer fails for inline elements</p>
<p>This tests that position 'static' no longer computes to 'absolute' for an
element that has been removed from the top layer. The test passes if you see
a single line of text.</p>
<span class="green">This is the span.</span>
<span class="green">This is the dialog following it.</span>
