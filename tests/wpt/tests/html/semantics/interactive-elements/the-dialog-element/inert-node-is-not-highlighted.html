<p>Test that inert nodes are not painted as being selected. The test passes if
none of the text outside the dialog is highlighted when selected.</p>

<p>Although not shown as selected, the inert nodes are in window.getSelection()
and copied to the clipboard, which is the same behavior as user-select:
none (crbug.com/147490).</p>

<br>  <!-- Needed to the trigger the bug. -->
This text shouldn't be highlighted as selected.

<dialog>
    <div id="selectable">I'm selectable.</div>
</dialog>

<script>
dialog = document.querySelector('dialog');
dialog.showModal();
document.execCommand('SelectAll');
