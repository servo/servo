00:00:31.000 --> 00:01:00.500 align:start position:20%
This cue has a less than < character.
It turns everything from there on into an annotation
for an empty tag and ends only at the next &gt; or &amp; character.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:02:00.500 align:start position:20%
This cue has a greater than > character.
Since it's not related to a &lt; character,
it's just interpreted as text.
