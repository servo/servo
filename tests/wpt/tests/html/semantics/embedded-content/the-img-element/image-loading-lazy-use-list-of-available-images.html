  // lazyload-specific action. This means that lazyload images can load eagerly
  // if they target a resource in the list of available images, which the image
  // below is doing.
  //
  // Note that if https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7005 resolves in favor
  // of allowing in-flight image requests to be placed in the list of available
  // images, as opposed to just complete images, this would allow lazyload
  // images (in addition to non-lazyload ones) to coalesce with these in-flight
  // entries in the list of available images too. In that case we'd need to test
  // for this here.
