// This is a regression test for a Chromium crash: https://crbug.com/40277823.
// The test is reproducible by:
//   1. Creating a node with an event listener for an event type that the
//      compositor cares about; `touchmove` in this case.
//   2. Adopting that node into a tree with a *different* local root (i.e., a
//      tree where the root is a local frame, different from this document, with
//      a remote parent).
//   3. Maintaining a reference to the node that now exists in a different local
//      frame root.
//   4. Add a same-type event listener to the document that used to host the
//      now-adopted node. This fails an assertion in the event handler
//      registry's consistency checker, which is mistakenly holding a reference
//      to the node that is now hosted in a different local frame root, which
//      the checker does not expect.

  const crossOriginChildURL = new URL('resources/cross-origin-middle-frame.html', get_host_info().HTTP_REMOTE_ORIGIN + location.pathname);

  const grandchildLoadPromise = new Promise(resolve => {
    window.onmessage = e => {

      }

  const sameOriginGrandchild = window.frames[0][0];

  button.addEventListener('touchmove', e => {});

  // This is important because before https://crbug.com/40277823 was fixed, it
  // would prevent the garbage collector from removing `button` from this
  // document's event handler registry. As long as it's still (incorrectly) in
  // the registry when we add the `touchmove` event handler is added to this
  // document later (post-adoption), the registry's consistency checker would
  // crash, asserting that the still-tracked event target is rooted at its *old*
  // local frame root.
  window.buttonHolder = button;

  sameOriginGrandchild.document.adoptNode(button);
  // This below would previously cause the Chromium crash.
