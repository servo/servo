/*
  When a new window is opened through window.open() it will contain the initial
  empty document. If the URL parameter is set to the URL that doesn't load a
  new document (e.g. it results in a HTTP 204 response), it will stay on the
  initial empty document. If fragment navigations happen, it will still stay on
  the initial empty document.
  These tests verify the behavior of navigations that happen on the initial
  empty document in that situation. They should all be converted to do a
  replacement.
