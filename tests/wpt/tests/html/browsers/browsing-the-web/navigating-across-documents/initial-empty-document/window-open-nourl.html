  When a new window is opened through window.open() it will contain the initial
  empty document. If the URL parameter is not set, it will stay on the initial
  empty document.
  These tests verify the behavior of navigations that happen on the initial
  empty document in that situation. They should all be converted to do a
  replacement.
