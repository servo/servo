<title>Beforeunload must be gated behind sticky activation: normal top-level browsing context</title>

<p>This test is manual because we want to test non-popup, non-iframe situations. Sibling files contain automated tests for those situations.

<p>In three seconds, this document will redirect itself to a new page. The test passes if the redirect succeeds. The test fails if a beforeunload dialog pops up asking for confirmation.

<p>Be sure not to interact with any part of the page in the meantime. That would invalidate the results.

<script>
window.onbeforeunload = e => e.preventDefault();

setTimeout(() => {
  location.href = 'support/beforeunload-sticky-destination.html';
}, 3000);
