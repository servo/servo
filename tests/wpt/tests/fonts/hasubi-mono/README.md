This font is a monospace Arabic font, which helps test the interaction of bidi
with line breaking, among other features.

Some operating systems already ship with a monospace Arabic font by default, but
not all do, so it is better to use a webfont.

This font was obtained from https://github.com/eliheuer/hasubi-mono.
