# Running Tests

```eval_rst
.. toctree::

   from-web
   from-local-system
   from-ci
   custom-runner
   ../tools/certs/README.md
```

The simplest way to run the tests is via the public website. More detail on
that approach is available in [Running tests from the Web](from-web).

Contributors who are interested in modifying and creating tests should refer to
[Running Tests from the Local System](from-local-system).

Contributors with write access to the repository can also trigger full runs
in our CI setups, see [Running Tests on CI](from-ci).

Advanced use cases may call for a customized method of executing the tests.
Guidelines for writing a custom "runner" are available at [Writing Your Own
Runner](custom-runner).
