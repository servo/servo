# Email Filters

See the [GitHub support page](https://help.github.com/articles/about-email-notifications/)
for how to filter certain types of email notifications. These are the most
useful `Cc` addresses when reviewing in web-platform-tests:
- `review_requested@noreply.github.com` when you are added as a (suggested) `reviewer` on a pull request.
- `assign@noreply.github.com` when you are added as the `assignee` (i.e. as _the_ reviewer) on a pull request.
