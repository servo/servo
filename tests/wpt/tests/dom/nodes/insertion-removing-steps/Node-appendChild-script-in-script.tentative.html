  // already-connected-but-empty `s1` script, runs first. This is because when
  // the DocumentFragment `df` containing this script (`s2`) is appended to
  // `s1`, we do not immediately execute `s1`, because of this condition: [1].
  // It specifies that when a "node or document fragment is inserted into the
  // script", we only run the "prepare the script algorithm" for that script
  // "after any script elements inserted at that time".
  //
  // So upon insertion of `s2`, its insertion conditions are met and it is
  // prepared and run first. During its execution, it mutates `s1`, adding more
  // text to it. This condition still does not trigger the immediate execution
  // of `s1`, because `s2`'s insertion is not complete yet.
  //
  // Once `s2` is finished being inserted, the condition to prepare and execute
  // `s1` is met, and it is processed accordingly, which includes the execution
  // of the text that `s2` added to `s1`.
