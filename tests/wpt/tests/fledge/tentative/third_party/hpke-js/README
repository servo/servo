This is built from hpke-js from https://github.com/dajiaji/hpke-js, version 1.2.9

The build was done using the "Cloudflare Workers" instructions for the whole library,
except the last step was changed from:
  deno task minify > $YOUR_SRC_PATH/hpke.js
to
  esbuild npm/esm/mod.js --bundle --format=esm > $YOUR_SRC_PATH/hpke.js

...which disabled minification, for easier debugging.
