# Referrer Policy Test Suite

The Referrer-Policy tests are designed for testing browser implementations and conformance to the [W3 Referrer-Policy Specification](http://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/referrer-policy/).

The subdirectory `gen/` is generated using the generator at `common/security-features`.
See [common/security-features/README.md](../common/security-features/README.md) for how to generate tests.
