          This automated pull request updates interfaces/*.idl from [@webref/idl ${{ env.webref_idl_version }}](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/idl/v/${{ env.webref_idl_version }}).

          Before merging, please check that any tests that depend on the updated IDL files still work. In particular, check for **gray boxes as the wpt.fyi check status**, which usually means that some tests have regressed.

          If additional changes are needed, please manually create another PR based on this one.

          See the [workflow](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/.github/workflows/interfaces.yml) for how this pull request was created, and the [README](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/interfaces/README.md) for how the IDL files in this directory are used.
