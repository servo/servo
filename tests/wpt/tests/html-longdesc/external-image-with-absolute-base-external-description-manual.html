  <title>Longdesc test: External image, external description, absolute base</title>
  <base href="https://rawgithub.com/chaals/longdesc-tests/master/rebased/">
 </head>
 <body>
  <p>Note that this test currently uses a target URL for the base that is not necessarily reliable long-term. It should be updated by anyone who wants to use the test "for real", pointing to some reliably stable repository</p>
  <img src="picture2.png" alt="the image" longdesc="fail.html">
  <p>If the image is broken, the base element has not been interpreted correctly so the test result is unknowable</p>
