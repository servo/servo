    <p>This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought single-handed,
      through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee cantonment. Darzee, the
      Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the musk-rat, who never comes out into 
      the middle of the floor, but always creeps round by the wall, gave him advice, 
      but Rikki-tikki did the real fighting.</p>
