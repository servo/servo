#  TODO(#42482): Merge this file with response_completed.py
#
# The status codes in this file are currently problematic in some implementations.
#
# The only mechanism currently provided by WPT to disable subtests with
# expectations is to disable the entire file. As such, this file is a copy of
# response_completed.py with the problematic status codes extracted.
#
# Once it is possible to disable subtests, this file should be merged with
# response_completed.py.
