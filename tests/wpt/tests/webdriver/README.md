# WebDriver specification tests

Herein lies a set of conformance tests
for the W3C web browser automation specification
known as [WebDriver](http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/).
The purpose of these tests is determine implementation compliance
so that different driver implementations can determine
whether they meet the recognized standard.

## Chapters of the Spec that still need tests

We are using a [tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUK_sdY2cv59VAJNDxZQIfypnOpapSQhMjfcJ9Wc42U/edit#gid=0)
to coordinate work on these tests. Please look there to see who
is working on what, and which areas are currently under-tested.

The spec contributors and editors can frequently be found on the W3C
#webdriver IRC channel.
