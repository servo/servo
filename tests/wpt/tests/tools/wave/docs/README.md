# WAVE Test Runner Documentation

As part of the [WAVE project](https://cta.tech/Resources/Standards/WAVE-Project)
the WAVE Test Runner was implemented to run tests that confirm proper implementation
of specified features. The code base is used in different subprojects, each of which
may have different requirements and scopes, so some features and screenshots in 
this documentation may use specific contexts.
