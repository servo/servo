Reviewing and merging patches
=============================

Everyone is encouraged to review open pull requests. We only ask that you try
and think carefully, ask questions and are `excellent to one another`_. Code
review is our opportunity to share knowledge, design ideas and make friends.

When reviewing a patch try to keep each of these concepts in mind:

Architecture
------------

* Is the proposed change being made in the correct place?

Intent
------

* What is the change being proposed?
* Do we want this feature or is the bug they're fixing really a bug?

Implementation
--------------

* Does the change do what the author claims?
* Are there sufficient tests?
* Has it been documented?
* Will this change introduce new bugs?

Grammar and style
-----------------

These are small things that are not caught by the automated style checkers.

* Does a variable need a better name?
* Should this be a keyword argument?
