Asyncio Example Server
======================

This example is a basic HTTP/2 server written using `asyncio`_, using some
functionality that was introduced in Python 3.5. This server represents
basically just the same JSON-headers-returning server that was built in the
:doc:`basic-usage` document.

This example demonstrates some basic asyncio techniques.
