class H2Configuration(object):
    """
    An object that controls the way a single HTTP/2 connection behaves.

    This object allows the users to customize behaviour. In particular, it
    allows users to enable or disable optional features, or to otherwise handle
    various unusual behaviours.

    This object has very little behaviour of its own: it mostly just ensures
    that configuration is self-consistent.

    :param client_side: Whether this object is to be used on the client side of
        a connection, or on the server side. Affects the logic used by the
        state machine, the default settings values, the allowable stream IDs,
        and several other properties. Defaults to ``True``.
    :type client_side: ``bool``

    :param header_encoding: Controls whether the headers emitted by this object
        in events are transparently decoded to ``unicode`` strings, and what
        encoding is used to do that decoding. This defaults to ``None``,
        meaning that headers will be returned as bytes. To automatically
        decode headers (that is, to return them as unicode strings), this can
        be set to the string name of any encoding, e.g. ``'utf-8'``.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.0.0
           Changed default value from ``'utf-8'`` to ``None``

    :type header_encoding: ``str``, ``False``, or ``None``

    :param validate_outbound_headers: Controls whether the headers emitted
        by this object are validated against the rules in RFC 7540.
        Disabling this setting will cause outbound header validation to
        be skipped, and allow the object to emit headers that may be illegal
        according to RFC 7540. Defaults to ``True``.
    :type validate_outbound_headers: ``bool``

    :param normalize_outbound_headers: Controls whether the headers emitted
        by this object are normalized before sending.  Disabling this setting
        will cause outbound header normalization to be skipped, and allow
        the object to emit headers that may be illegal according to
        RFC 7540. Defaults to ``True``.
    :type normalize_outbound_headers: ``bool``

    :param validate_inbound_headers: Controls whether the headers received
        by this object are validated against the rules in RFC 7540.
        Disabling this setting will cause inbound header validation to
        be skipped, and allow the object to receive headers that may be illegal
        according to RFC 7540. Defaults to ``True``.
    :type validate_inbound_headers: ``bool``

    :param normalize_inbound_headers: Controls whether the headers received by
        this object are normalized according to the rules of RFC 7540.
        Disabling this setting may lead to hyper-h2 emitting header blocks that
        some RFCs forbid, e.g. with multiple cookie fields.

        .. versionadded:: 3.0.0

    :type normalize_inbound_headers: ``bool``

    :param logger: A logger that conforms to the requirements for this module,
        those being no I/O and no context switches, which is needed in order
        to run in asynchronous operation.

        .. versionadded:: 2.6.0
