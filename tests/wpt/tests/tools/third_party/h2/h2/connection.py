        This method differs from :meth:`initiate_connection

        Firstly, it handles the additional SETTINGS frame that is sent in the

        this method will return a bytestring that the caller can put in the
        ``HTTP2-Settings`` field they send on their initial request. When
        called on a server connection, the user **must** provide the value they
        received from the client in the ``HTTP2-Settings`` header field to the
        ``settings_header`` argument, which will be used appropriately.

        Additionally, this method sets up stream 1 in a half-closed state
        appropriate for this side of the connection, to reflect the fact that
        the request is already complete.

        Finally, this method also prepares the appropriate preamble to be sent

        Send headers on a given stream.

        This function can be used to send request or response headers: the kind
        that are sent depends on whether this connection has been opened as a
        client or server connection, and whether the stream was opened by the
        remote peer or not.

        If this is a client connection, calling ``send_headers`` will send the
        headers as a request. It will also implicitly open the stream being
        used. If this is a client connection and ``send_headers`` has *already*
        been called, this will send trailers instead.

        If this is a server connection, calling ``send_headers`` will send the
        headers as a response. It is a protocol error for a server to open a
        stream by sending headers. If this is a server connection and
        ``send_headers`` has *already* been called, this will send trailers
        instead.

        When acting as a server, you may call ``send_headers`` any number of
        times allowed by the following rules, in this order:

        - zero or more times with ``(':status', '1XX')`` (where ``1XX`` is a
          placeholder for any 100-level status code).
        - once with any other status header.
        - zero or one time for trailers.

        That is, you are allowed to send as many informational responses as you
        like, followed by one complete response and zero or one HTTP trailer
        blocks.

        Clients may send one or two header blocks: one request block, and
        optionally one trailer block.

        If it is important to send HPACK "never indexed" header fields (as
        defined in `RFC 7451 Section 7.1.3
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7541#section-7.1.3>`_), the user may
        instead provide headers using the HPACK library's :class:`HeaderTuple
        <hpack:hpack.HeaderTuple>` and :class:`NeverIndexedHeaderTuple
        <hpack:hpack.NeverIndexedHeaderTuple>` objects.

        This method also allows users to prioritize the stream immediately,
        by sending priority information on the HEADERS frame directly. To do
        this, any one of ``priority_weight``, ``priority_depends_on``, or
        ``priority_exclusive`` must be set to a value that is not ``None``. For
        more information on the priority fields, see :meth:`prioritize
        <h2.connection.H2Connection.prioritize>`.

        An Alternative Service is defined in `RFC 7838
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7838>`_. An Alternative Service
        notification informs a client that a given origin is also available
        elsewhere.

        Alternative Services can be advertised in two ways. Firstly, they can
        be advertised explicitly: that is, a server can say "origin X is also
        available at Y". To advertise like this, set the ``origin`` argument
        and not the ``stream_id`` argument. Alternatively, they can be
        advertised implicitly: that is, a server can say "the origin you're
        contacting on stream X is also available at Y". To advertise like this,
        set the ``stream_id`` argument and not the ``origin`` argument.

        The explicit method of advertising can be done as long as the
        connection is active. The implicit method can only be done after the
        client has sent the request headers and before the server has sent the
        response headers: outside of those points, Hyper-h2 will forbid sending
        the Alternative Service advertisement by raising a ProtocolError.

        The ``field_value`` parameter is specified in RFC 7838. Hyper-h2 does
        not validate or introspect this argument: the user is required to
        ensure that it's well-formed. ``field_value`` corresponds to RFC 7838's
        "Alternative Service Field Value".

        .. note:: It is strongly preferred to use the explicit method of
                  advertising Alternative Services. The implicit method of
                  advertising Alternative Services has a number of subtleties
                  and can lead to inconsistencies between the server and
                  client. Hyper-h2 allows both mechanisms, but caution is

        Notify a server about the priority of a stream.

        Stream priorities are a form of guidance to a remote server: they
        inform the server about how important a given response is, so that the
        server may allocate its resources (e.g. bandwidth, CPU time, etc.)
        accordingly. This exists to allow clients to ensure that the most
        important data arrives earlier, while less important data does not
        starve out the more important data.

        Stream priorities are explained in depth in `RFC 7540 Section 5.3
        <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5.3>`_.

        This method updates the priority information of a single stream. It may
        be called well before a stream is actively in use, or well after a
        stream is closed.

        .. warning:: RFC 7540 allows for servers to change the priority of
                     streams. However, hyper-h2 **does not** allow server
                     stacks to do this. This is because most clients do not
                     adequately know how to respond when provided conflicting
                     priority information, and relatively little utility is
                     provided by making that functionality available.

        .. note:: hyper-h2 **does not** maintain any information about the
                  RFC 7540 priority tree. That means that hyper-h2 does not
                  prevent incautious users from creating invalid priority
                  trees, particularly by creating priority loops. While some
                  basic error checking is provided by hyper-h2, users are
                  strongly recommended to understand their prioritisation
                  strategies before using the priority tools here.

        .. note:: Priority information is strictly advisory. Servers are
                  allowed to disregard it entirely. Avoid relying on the idea
                  that your priority signaling will definitely be obeyed.
