Server HTTPS Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example code fragment demonstrates how to set up a HTTP/2 server that
negotiates HTTP/2 using NPN and ALPN. For the sake of maximum explanatory value
this code uses the synchronous, low-level sockets API: however, if you're not
using sockets directly (e.g. because you're using asyncio), you should focus on
the set up required for the SSLContext object. For other concurrency libraries
you may need to use other setup (e.g. for Twisted you'll need to use
IProtocolNegotiationFactory).

This code requires Python 3.5 or later.
