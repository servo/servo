- added ability to ask "name in iniconfig", i.e. to check
  if a section is contained.

- fix bug in "name=value" parsing where value was "x=3"

- allow for ': ' to delimit name=value pairs, so that e.g. .pypirc files
  like http://docs.python.org/distutils/packageindex.html
  can be successfully parsed
