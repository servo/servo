Changes between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1
----------------------------------------

- fix issue99 (in pytest and py) internallerrors with resultlog now
  produce better output - fixed by normalizing pytest_internalerror
  input arguments.
- fix issue97 / traceback issues (in pytest and py) improve traceback output
  in conjunction with jinja2 and cython which hack tracebacks
- fix issue93 (in pytest and pytest-xdist) avoid "delayed teardowns":
  the final test in a test node will now run its teardown directly
  instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for
  the good reporting and feedback.  The pytest_runtest_protocol as well
  as the pytest_runtest_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available
  which will be None indicating the end of the test run.
- fix collection crash due to unknown-source collected items, thanks
  to Ralf Schmitt (fixed by depending on a more recent pylib)
