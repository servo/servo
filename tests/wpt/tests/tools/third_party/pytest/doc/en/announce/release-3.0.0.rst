pytest-3.0.0
============

The pytest team is proud to announce the 3.0.0 release!

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1600 tests
against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.

This release contains a lot of bugs fixes and improvements, and much of
the work done on it was possible because of the 2016 Sprint[1], which
was funded by an indiegogo campaign which raised over US$12,000 with
nearly 100 backers.

There's a "What's new in pytest 3.0" [2] blog post highlighting the
major features in this release.

To see the complete changelog and documentation, please visit:

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via:

    pip install -U pytest
