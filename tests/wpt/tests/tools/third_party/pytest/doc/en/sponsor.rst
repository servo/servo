Sponsor
=======

pytest is maintained by a team of volunteers from all around the world in their free time. While
we work on pytest because we love the project and use it daily at our daily jobs, monetary
compensation when possible is welcome to justify time away from friends, family and personal time.

Money is also used to fund local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example)
and every few years a large sprint involving all members.

OpenCollective

It provide tools to raise money and share your finances in full transparency.

It is the platform of choice for individuals and companies that want to make one-time or
monthly donations directly to the project.
