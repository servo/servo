pytest-7.0.0rc1
=======================================

The pytest team is proud to announce the 7.0.0rc1 prerelease!

This is a prerelease, not intended for production use, but to test the upcoming features and improvements
in order to catch any major problems before the final version is released to the major public.

We appreciate your help testing this out before the final release, making sure to report any
regressions to our issue tracker:

https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues

When doing so, please include the string ``[prerelease]`` in the title.

You can upgrade from PyPI via:

    pip install pytest==7.0.0rc1

Users are encouraged to take a look at the CHANGELOG carefully:
