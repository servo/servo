pytest-2.6.0: shorter tracebacks, new warning system, test runner compat
===========================================================================

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1000 tests
against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.

The 2.6.0 release should be drop-in backward compatible to 2.5.2 and
fixes a number of bugs and brings some new features, mainly:

- shorter tracebacks by default: only the first (test function) entry
  and the last (failure location) entry are shown, the ones between
  only in "short" format.  Use ``--tb=long`` to get back the old
  behaviour of showing "long" entries everywhere.

- a new warning system which reports oddities during collection
  and execution.  For example, ignoring collecting Test* classes with an
  ``__init__`` now produces a warning.

- various improvements to nose/mock/unittest integration

Note also that 2.6.0 departs with the "zero reported bugs" policy
because it has been too hard to keep up with it, unfortunately.
Instead we are for now rather bound to work on "upvoted" issues in
the https://bitbucket.org/pytest-dev/pytest/issues?status=new&status=open&sort=-votes
issue tracker.

See docs at:

    http://pytest.org

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via::

    pip install -U pytest

2.6.0
-----------------------------------

- fix issue537: Avoid importing old assertion reinterpretation code by default.
  Thanks Benjamin Peterson.

- fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default.
  The new "--tb=auto" option (default) will only display long tracebacks
  for the first and last entry.  You can get the old behaviour of printing
  all entries as long entries with "--tb=long".  Also short entries by
  default are now printed very similarly to "--tb=native" ones.

- fix issue514: teach assertion reinterpretation about private class attributes
  Thanks Benjamin Peterson.

- change -v output to include full node IDs of tests.  Users can copy
  a node ID from a test run, including line number, and use it as a
  positional argument in order to run only a single test.

- fix issue 475: fail early and comprehensible if calling
  pytest.raises with wrong exception type.

- fix issue516: tell in getting-started about current dependencies.

- cleanup setup.py a bit and specify supported versions. Thanks Jurko
  Gospodnetic for the PR.

- change XPASS colour to yellow rather then red when tests are run
  with -v.

- fix issue473: work around mock putting an unbound method into a class
  dict when double-patching.

- fix issue498: if a fixture finalizer fails, make sure that
  the fixture is still invalidated.

- fix issue453: the result of the pytest_assertrepr_compare hook now gets
  it's newlines escaped so that format_exception does not blow up.

- internal new warning system: pytest will now produce warnings when
  it detects oddities in your test collection or execution.
  Warnings are ultimately sent to a new pytest_logwarning hook which is
  currently only implemented by the terminal plugin which displays
  warnings in the summary line and shows more details when -rw (report on
  warnings) is specified.

- change skips into warnings for test classes with an __init__ and
  callables in test modules which look like a test but are not functions.

- fix issue436: improved finding of initial conftest files from command
  line arguments by using the result of parse_known_args rather than
  the previous flaky heuristics.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz for tests
  and initial fixing approaches in this area.

- fix issue #479: properly handle nose/unittest(2) SkipTest exceptions
  during collection/loading of test modules.  Thanks to Marc Schlaich
  for the complete PR.

- fix issue490: include pytest_load_initial_conftests in documentation
  and improve docstring.

- fix issue472: clarify that ``pytest.config.getvalue()`` cannot work
  if it's triggered ahead of command line parsing.

- merge PR123: improved integration with mock.patch decorator on tests.

- fix issue412: messing with stdout/stderr FD-level streams is now
  captured without crashes.

- fix issue483: trial/py33 works now properly.  Thanks Daniel Grana for PR.

- improve example for pytest integration with "python setup.py test"
  which now has a generic "-a" or "--pytest-args" option where you
  can pass additional options as a quoted string.  Thanks Trevor Bekolay.

- simplified internal capturing mechanism and made it more robust
  against tests or setups changing FD1/FD2, also better integrated
  now with pytest.pdb() in single tests.

- improvements to pytest's own test-suite leakage detection, courtesy of PRs
  from Marc Abramowitz

- fix issue492: avoid leak in test_writeorg.  Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

- fix issue493: don't run tests in doc directory with ``python setup.py test``
  (use tox -e doctesting for that)

- fix issue486: better reporting and handling of early conftest loading failures

- some cleanup and simplification of internal conftest handling.

- work a bit harder to break reference cycles when catching exceptions.
  Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic.

- fix issue443: fix skip examples to use proper comparison.  Thanks Alex
  Groenholm.

- support nose-style ``__test__`` attribute on modules, classes and
  functions, including unittest-style Classes.  If set to False, the
  test will not be collected.

- fix issue512: show "<notset>" for arguments which might not be set
  in monkeypatch plugin.  Improves output in documentation.

- avoid importing "py.test" (an old alias module for "pytest")
