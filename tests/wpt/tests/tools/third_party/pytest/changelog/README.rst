This directory contains "newsfragments" which are short files that contain a small **ReST**-formatted
text that will be added to the next ``CHANGELOG``.

The ``CHANGELOG`` will be read by **users**, so this description should be aimed to pytest users
instead of describing internal changes which are only relevant to the developers.

Make sure to use full sentences in the **past or present tense** and use punctuation, examples::

    Improved verbose diff output with sequences.

    Terminal summary statistics now use multiple colors.

Each file should be named like ``<ISSUE>.<TYPE>.rst``, where
``<ISSUE>`` is an issue number, and ``<TYPE>`` is one of:

* ``feature``: new user facing features, like new command-line options and new behavior.
* ``improvement``: improvement of existing functionality, usually without requiring user intervention (for example, new fields being written in ``--junitxml``, improved colors in terminal, etc).
* ``bugfix``: fixes a bug.
* ``doc``: documentation improvement, like rewording an entire session or adding missing docs.
* ``deprecation``: feature deprecation.
* ``breaking``: a change which may break existing suites, such as feature removal or behavior change.
* ``vendor``: changes in packages vendored in pytest.
* ``trivial``: fixing a small typo or internal change that might be noteworthy.

So for example: ``123.feature.rst``, ``456.bugfix.rst``.

If your PR fixes an issue, use that number here. If there is no issue,
then after you submit the PR and get the PR number you can add a
changelog using that instead.

If you are not sure what issue type to use, don't hesitate to ask in your PR.

``towncrier`` preserves multiple paragraphs and formatting (code blocks, lists, and so on), but for entries
other than ``features`` it is usually better to stick to a single paragraph to keep it concise.

You can also run ``tox -e docs`` to build the documentation
with the draft changelog (``doc/en/_build/html/changelog.html``) if you want to get a preview of how your change will look in the final release notes.
