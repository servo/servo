==============
OpenCollective
==============

pytest has a collective setup at `OpenCollective`_. This document describes how the core team manages
OpenCollective-related activities.

What is it
==========

Open Collective is an online funding platform for open and transparent communities.
It provides tools to raise money and share your finances in full transparency.

It is the platform of choice for individuals and companies that want to make one-time or
monthly donations directly to the project.

Funds
=====

The OpenCollective funds donated to pytest will be used to fund overall maintenance,
local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example), and future
gatherings of pytest developers (sprints).

`Core contributors`_ which are contributing on a continuous basis are free to submit invoices
to bill maintenance hours using the platform. How much each contributor should request is still an
open question, but we should use common sense and trust in the contributors, most of which know
themselves in-person. A good rule of thumb is to bill the same amount as monthly payments
contributors which participate in the `Tidelift`_ subscription. If in doubt, just ask.

Admins
======

A few people have admin access to the OpenCollective dashboard to make changes. Those people
are part of the `@pytest-dev/opencollective-admins`_ team.

`Core contributors`_ interested in helping out with OpenCollective maintenance are welcome! We don't
expect much work here other than the occasional approval of expenses from other core contributors.
Just drop a line to one of the `@pytest-dev/opencollective-admins`_ or use the mailing list.
