Tidelift is working with the maintainers of websockets and thousands of other
open source projects to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the
open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce
risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact
dependencies you use.

Enterprise-ready open source software—managed for you
-----------------------------------------------------

The Tidelift Subscription is a managed open source subscription for
application dependencies covering millions of open source projects across
JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, and more.

Your subscription includes:

* **Security updates**

  * Tidelift’s security response team coordinates patches for new breaking
    security vulnerabilities and alerts immediately through a private channel,
    so your software supply chain is always secure.

* **Licensing verification and indemnification**

  * Tidelift verifies license information to enable easy policy enforcement
    and adds intellectual property indemnification to cover creators and users
    in case something goes wrong. You always have a 100% up-to-date bill of
    materials for your dependencies to share with your legal team, customers,
    or partners.

* **Maintenance and code improvement**

  * Tidelift ensures the software you rely on keeps working as long as you
    need it to work. Your managed dependencies are actively maintained and we
    recruit additional maintainers where required.

* **Package selection and version guidance**

  * We help you choose the best open source packages from the start—and then
    guide you through updates to stay on the best releases as new issues
    arise.

* **Roadmap input**

  * Take a seat at the table with the creators behind the software you use.
    Tidelift’s participating maintainers earn more income as their software is
    used by more subscribers, so they’re interested in knowing what you need.

* **Tooling and cloud integration**

  * Tidelift works with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more. We support every
    cloud platform (and other deployment targets, too).

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade
software, for the full breadth of open source you use. That means less time
grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own
applications—and your business.
