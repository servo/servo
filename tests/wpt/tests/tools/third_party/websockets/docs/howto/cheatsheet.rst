.. currentmodule:: websockets

Server
------

* Write a coroutine that handles a single connection. It receives a WebSocket
  protocol instance and the URI path in argument.

  * Call :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv` and
    :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.send` to receive and send
    messages at any time.

  * When :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv` or
    :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.send` raises
    :exc:`~exceptions.ConnectionClosed`, clean up and exit. If you started
    other :class:`asyncio.Task`, terminate them before exiting.

  * If you aren't awaiting :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv`,
    consider awaiting :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.wait_closed`
    to detect quickly when the connection is closed.

  * You may :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.ping` or
    :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.pong` if you wish but it isn't
    needed in general.

* Create a server with :func:`~server.serve` which is similar to asyncio's
  :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_server`. You can also use it as an asynchronous
  context manager.

  * The server takes care of establishing connections, then lets the handler
    execute the application logic, and finally closes the connection after the
    handler exits normally or with an exception.

  * For advanced customization, you may subclass
    :class:`~server.WebSocketServerProtocol` and pass either this subclass or
    a factory function as the ``create_protocol`` argument.

Client
------

* Create a client with :func:`~client.connect` which is similar to asyncio's
  :meth:`~asyncio.loop.create_connection`. You can also use it as an
  asynchronous context manager.

  * For advanced customization, you may subclass
    :class:`~client.WebSocketClientProtocol` and pass either this subclass or
    a factory function as the ``create_protocol`` argument.

* Call :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.recv` and
  :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.send` to receive and send messages
  at any time.

* You may :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.ping` or
  :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.pong` if you wish but it isn't
  needed in general.

* If you aren't using :func:`~client.connect` as a context manager, call
  :meth:`~legacy.protocol.WebSocketCommonProtocol.close` to terminate the connection.

Debugging
---------

If you don't understand what websockets is doing, enable logging::

    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger('websockets')
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

The logs contain:

* Exceptions in the connection handler at the ``ERROR`` level
* Exceptions in the opening or closing handshake at the ``INFO`` level
* All frames at the ``DEBUG`` level â€” this can be very verbose

If you're new to ``asyncio``, you will certainly encounter issues that are
related to asynchronous programming in general rather than to websockets in
particular. Fortunately Python's official documentation provides advice to
`develop with asyncio`_. Check it out: it's invaluable!
