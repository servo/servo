Contributions
-------------

Bug reports, patches and suggestions are welcome!

Please open an issue_ or send a `pull request`_.

Feedback about the documentation is especially valuable â€” the authors of
``websockets`` feel more confident about writing code than writing docs :-)

If you're wondering why things are done in a certain way, the :doc:`design
document <design>` provides lots of details about the internals of websockets.

Questions
---------

GitHub issues aren't a good medium for handling questions. There are better
places to ask questions, for example Stack Overflow.

If you want to ask a question anyway, please make sure that:

- it's a question about ``websockets`` and not about :mod:`asyncio`;
- it isn't answered by the documentation;
- it wasn't asked already.

A good question can be written as a suggestion to improve the documentation.

Bitcoin users
-------------

websockets appears to be quite popular for interfacing with Bitcoin or other
cryptocurrency trackers. I'm strongly opposed to Bitcoin's carbon footprint.

Please stop heating the planet where my children are supposed to live, thanks.

Since ``websockets`` is released under an open-source license, you can use it
for any purpose you like. However, I won't spend any of my time to help.

I will summarily close issues related to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in any way.
