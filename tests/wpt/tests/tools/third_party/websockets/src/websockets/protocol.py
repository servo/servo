# A WebSocket connection goes through the following four states, in order:

class WebSocketCommonProtocol(asyncio.Protocol):
    """
    :class:`~asyncio.Protocol` subclass implementing the data transfer phase.

    Once the WebSocket connection is established, during the data transfer
    phase, the protocol is almost symmetrical between the server side and the
    client side. :class:`WebSocketCommonProtocol` implements logic that's
    shared between servers and clients..

    Subclasses such as :class:`~websockets.server.WebSocketServerProtocol` and
    :class:`~websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol` implement the opening
    handshake, which is different between servers and clients.

    :class:`WebSocketCommonProtocol` performs four functions:

    * It runs a task that stores incoming data frames in a queue and makes
      them available with the :meth:`recv` coroutine.
    * It sends outgoing data frames with the :meth:`send` coroutine.
    * It deals with control frames automatically.
    * It performs the closing handshake.

    :class:`WebSocketCommonProtocol` supports asynchronous iteration::

        async for message in websocket:
            await process(message)

    The iterator yields incoming messages. It exits normally when the
    connection is closed with the close code 1000 (OK) or 1001 (going away).
    It raises a :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError` exception
    when the connection is closed with any other code.

    Once the connection is open, a `Ping frame`_ is sent every
    ``ping_interval`` seconds. This serves as a keepalive. It helps keeping
    the connection open, especially in the presence of proxies with short
    timeouts on inactive connections. Set ``ping_interval`` to ``None`` to
    disable this behavior.

    .. _Ping frame: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.2

    If the corresponding `Pong frame`_ isn't received within ``ping_timeout``
    seconds, the connection is considered unusable and is closed with
    code 1011. This ensures that the remote endpoint remains responsive. Set
    ``ping_timeout`` to ``None`` to disable this behavior.

    .. _Pong frame: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.3

    The ``close_timeout`` parameter defines a maximum wait time in seconds for
    completing the closing handshake and terminating the TCP connection.
    :meth:`close` completes in at most ``4 * close_timeout`` on the server
    side and ``5 * close_timeout`` on the client side.

    ``close_timeout`` needs to be a parameter of the protocol because
    ``websockets`` usually calls :meth:`close` implicitly:

    - on the server side, when the connection handler terminates,
    - on the client side, when exiting the context manager for the connection.

    To apply a timeout to any other API, wrap it in :func:`~asyncio.wait_for`.

    The ``max_size`` parameter enforces the maximum size for incoming messages
    in bytes. The default value is 1 MiB. ``None`` disables the limit. If a
    message larger than the maximum size is received, :meth:`recv` will
    raise :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError` and the
    connection will be closed with code 1009.

    The ``max_queue`` parameter sets the maximum length of the queue that
    holds incoming messages. The default value is ``32``. ``None`` disables
    the limit. Messages are added to an in-memory queue when they're received;
    then :meth:`recv` pops from that queue. In order to prevent excessive
    memory consumption when messages are received faster than they can be
    processed, the queue must be bounded. If the queue fills up, the protocol
    stops processing incoming data until :meth:`recv` is called. In this
    situation, various receive buffers (at least in ``asyncio`` and in the OS)
    will fill up, then the TCP receive window will shrink, slowing down
    transmission to avoid packet loss.

    Since Python can use up to 4 bytes of memory to represent a single
    character, each connection may use up to ``4 * max_size * max_queue``
    bytes of memory to store incoming messages. By default, this is 128 MiB.
    You may want to lower the limits, depending on your application's
    requirements.

    The ``read_limit`` argument sets the high-water limit of the buffer for
    incoming bytes. The low-water limit is half the high-water limit. The
    default value is 64 KiB, half of asyncio's default (based on the current
    implementation of :class:`~asyncio.StreamReader`).

    The ``write_limit`` argument sets the high-water limit of the buffer for
    outgoing bytes. The low-water limit is a quarter of the high-water limit.
    The default value is 64 KiB, equal to asyncio's default (based on the
    current implementation of ``FlowControlMixin``).

    As soon as the HTTP request and response in the opening handshake are
    processed:

    * the request path is available in the :attr:`path` attribute;
    * the request and response HTTP headers are available in the
      :attr:`request_headers` and :attr:`response_headers` attributes,
      which are :class:`~websockets.http.Headers` instances.

    If a subprotocol was negotiated, it's available in the :attr:`subprotocol`
    attribute.

    Once the connection is closed, the code is available in the
    :attr:`close_code` attribute and the reason in :attr:`close_reason`.

    All these attributes must be treated as read-only.
