What is ``websockets``?
-----------------------

websockets is a library for building WebSocket_ servers and clients in Python
with a focus on correctness, simplicity, robustness, and performance.

.. _WebSocket: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API

Built on top of ``asyncio``, Python's standard asynchronous I/O framework, the
default implementation provides an elegant coroutine-based API.

An implementation on top of ``threading`` and a Sans-I/O implementation are also
available.

`Documentation is available on Read the Docs. <https://websockets.readthedocs.io/>`_

Here's an echo server with the ``asyncio`` API:

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import asyncio
    from websockets.server import serve

    async def echo(websocket):
        async for message in websocket:
            await websocket.send(message)

    async def main():
        async with serve(echo, "localhost", 8765):
            await asyncio.Future()  # run forever

    asyncio.run(main())

Here's how a client sends and receives messages with the ``threading`` API:

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from websockets.sync.client import connect

    def hello():
        with connect("ws://localhost:8765") as websocket:
            websocket.send("Hello world!")
            message = websocket.recv()
            print(f"Received: {message}")

    hello()


Does that look good?

Why should I use ``websockets``?
--------------------------------

The development of ``websockets`` is shaped by four principles:

1. **Correctness**: ``websockets`` is heavily tested for compliance with
   :rfc:`6455`. Continuous integration fails under 100% branch coverage.

2. **Simplicity**: all you need to understand is ``msg = await ws.recv()`` and
   ``await ws.send(msg)``. ``websockets`` takes care of managing connections
   so you can focus on your application.

3. **Robustness**: ``websockets`` is built for production. For example, it was
   the only library to `handle backpressure correctly`_ before the issue
   became widely known in the Python community.

4. **Performance**: memory usage is optimized and configurable. A C extension
   accelerates expensive operations. It's pre-compiled for Linux, macOS and
   Windows and packaged in the wheel format for each system and Python version.

Documentation is a first class concern in the project. Head over to `Read the
Docs`_ and see for yourself.

.. _Read the Docs: https://websockets.readthedocs.io/

Why shouldn't I use ``websockets``?
-----------------------------------

* If you prefer callbacks over coroutines: ``websockets`` was created to
  provide the best coroutine-based API to manage WebSocket connections in
  Python. Pick another library for a callback-based API.

* If you're looking for a mixed HTTP / WebSocket library: ``websockets`` aims
  at being an excellent implementation of :rfc:`6455`: The WebSocket Protocol
  and :rfc:`7692`: Compression Extensions for WebSocket. Its support for HTTP
  is minimal â€” just enough for an HTTP health check.

  If you want to do both in the same server, look at HTTP frameworks that
  build on top of ``websockets`` to support WebSocket connections, like
  Sanic_.
