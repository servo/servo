  <h4>Test Your Annotation Client <em>Today!</em></h4>

  <blockquote>A conforming Web Annotation Protocol client SHOULD be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>start from this page</li>
      <li>discover the <em>recommended</em> AnnotationCollection</li>
      <li>read existing annotations from that AnnotationCollection</li>
      <li>create, update, and delete annotations from that AnnotationCollection</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Interoperability between systems has two basic aspects: the syntax and semantics of the data that is moved between the systems, and the transport mechanism for that movement. The HTTP protocol and the Web architecture provides us with a great starting point for a standardized transport layer, and can be used to move content between systems easily and effectively. Building upon these foundations allows us to make use of existing technology and patterns to ensure consistency and ease of development.</p>

  <p>The Web Annotation Protocol describes a transport mechanism for creating, managing, and retrieving Annotations. Annotations in this specification are assumed to follow the requirements of the Web Annotation Data Model [<cite><a href="#bib-annotation-model" class="bibref">annotation-model</a></cite>] and Web Annotation Vocabulary [<cite><a href="#bib-annotation-vocab" class="bibref">annotation-vocab</a></cite>]. This specification builds upon REST principles and the Linked Data Platform [<cite><a href="#bib-ldp" class="bibref">ldp</a></cite>] recommendation, and familiarity with it is recommended.</p>
