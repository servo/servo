This directory contains the old reftest chaining tests, based on how they worked prior to
[RFC #15](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/reftest_simplification.md).

The expectations for these match the current logic; these are included here so we have
tests that fail if any external runner is implementing this logic.
