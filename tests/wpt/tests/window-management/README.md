# Window Management Testing

[Window Management Specification](https://w3c.github.io/window-management/)

The tests in this directory require at least 2 displays on the host machine to
yield meaningful results. An example configuration is 2 displays with 1920x1080
resolution arranged horizontally (primary on the left, secondary on the right).
