<title>Nested fenced frame named navigation helper</title>
<!-- This is a helper file. It is meant to be the document loaded inside a
     nested fenced frame by `navigate-by-name-inner.html`. Once this document is
     loaded and changes its `window.name` to `target_frame`, it reports to the
     server so that the outermost document can attempt to navigate it by name.
     (The navigation should not succeed - see the test expectations).

  const [ready_for_navigation_key] = parseKeylist();
  window.name = "target_frame";
  writeValueToServer(ready_for_navigation_key, "READY");
