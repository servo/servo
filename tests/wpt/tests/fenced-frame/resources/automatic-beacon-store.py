"""
Automatic beacon store server.

- When a request body is specified, stores the data in the body and serves a 200
  response without body.
- When a request body is not specified, serves a 200 response whose body
  contains the stored value from the automatic beacon. Since the data is stored
  using a hash of the data as the key, it expects an `expected_body` query
  parameter to know what key to look up. If the stored value doesn't exist,
  serves a 200 response with an empty body.
