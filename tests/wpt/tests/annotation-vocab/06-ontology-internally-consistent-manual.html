    <p>The Annotation Vocabulary JSON-LD context is defined to be at http://www.w3.org/ns/oa</p>
    <p>One ontology of that context is at http://www.w3.org/ns/oa.ttl</p>
    <p>Parse that ontology and evaluate its domains and ranges.  Are they
    consistent with the underlying referenced data types?</p>
