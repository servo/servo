Tests for the [Files and Directory Entries API](https://github.com/wicg/entries-api)

* [Explainer](https://github.com/WICG/entries-api/blob/gh-pages/EXPLAINER.md)
* [Draft Specification](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/)

Unfortunately, most of the tests are **manual** and require drag-and-drop of test
data files, which can be found in the `entries-api/support` directory. The tests
can be run via [wpt.live](http://wpt.live/entries-api/), but a local clone
of the repo is required for access to the test data files.
