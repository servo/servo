<p>This test validates that image resources which are part of an element's
UA-defined interface are not exposed to the performance timeline. This uses an
&lt;audio&gt; element as an example of an element with internal resources used
for the playback controls, and verifies that resource timing entries are not
created.
</p>

<!-- This element will render with internal resources for playback controls -->
<audio controls></audio>
