## Device/system dependency

The Media Session specification defines behaviors related to device or system
features such as the actions to run when a software/hardware media key is used.
These behaviors are not tested because they would depend on user agent specific
implementations and device specific features.

## Status of these tests

These tests are not complete and only reflect the Blink tests that could be
exported. If a reader find a behavior that could be tested and is not, they
should feel free to file a bug.
