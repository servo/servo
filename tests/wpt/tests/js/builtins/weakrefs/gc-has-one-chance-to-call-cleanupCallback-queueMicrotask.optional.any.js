  FinalizationRegistry ( cleanupCallback )

  FinalizationRegistry.prototype.cleanupSome ( [ callback ] )

  ...
  4. If callback is not undefined and IsCallable(callback) is false, throw a TypeError exception.
  5. Perform ? CleanupFinalizationRegistry(finalizationRegistry, callback).
  6. Return undefined.

  Execution

  At any time, if an object obj is not live, an ECMAScript implementation may perform the following steps atomically:

  1. For each WeakRef ref such that ref.[[Target]] is obj,
    a. Set ref.[[Target]] to empty.
  2. For each FinalizationRegistry finalizationRegistry such that finalizationRegistry.[[Cells]] contains cell, such that cell.[[Target]] is obj,
    a. Set cell.[[Target]] to empty.
    b. Optionally, perform ! HostCleanupFinalizationRegistry(finalizationRegistry).
