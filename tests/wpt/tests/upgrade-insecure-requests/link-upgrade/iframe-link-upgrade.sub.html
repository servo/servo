<!--
  This document has set "Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests". It
  contains an iframe. This iframe clicks on a link to the same host. The link
  must be upgraded.

  This is a bit of a hack. UPGRADE doesn't upgrade the port number. So if
  the url is not upgraded, the url is invalid (http over the https port).
  The expected behavior is that the url is upgraded and the page loads.
