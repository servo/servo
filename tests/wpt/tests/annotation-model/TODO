Things still to be developed:

Script to run .jsonld files in tools/tests against .test files

Script to batch run submitted .jsonld files from an implementation against .test
files

Websocket communication to runner tests with a corresponding listener that an
implementation could use to auto-submit jsonld into the "manual" tests

Add a Skip option to tools/runner

Add a tuple mode for evaluating RDF declaratively as well.
