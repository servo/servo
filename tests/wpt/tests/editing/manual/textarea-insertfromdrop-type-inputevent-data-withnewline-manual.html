<title>Manual drag and drop text</title>

<textarea id="text" rows="16" cols="60">Please select a paragraph of the text in this textarea,
    so the selected text has a newline either at the start or end or both the places and then
    drag-and-drop the selected text to a different section of the textarea.

    It is expected that "deleteByDrag" events will have no data (data == null), but it is
    expected that "insertFromDrop" events populate the data attribute with the text that was
    dropped / inserted.

    If you see "insertFromDrop" events having the data that was dragged and dropped, then the
    test passes.
