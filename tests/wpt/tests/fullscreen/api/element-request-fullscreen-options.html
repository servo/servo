    // Tests for https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/pull/129. Because there are
    // no normative requirements on what navigationUI should do, just test for
    // basic support. (One could also check that the three allowed enum valid are
    // supported and no others, but that would overlap with UA-specific tests.)
