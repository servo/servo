// ArrayBuffers can be at most 4GB (minus 1 byte), but any allocations larger than 1 GB are unreliable in practice. So limit allocations to 1 GB.
// Textures that are wide in just one dimension can still be used to test max TEXTURE_2D size limit even if we can't allocate space for huge square textures.
// Use a fairly conservative limit for positive test cube map size so OOM is avoided.
