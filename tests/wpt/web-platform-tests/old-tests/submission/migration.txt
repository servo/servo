    Google          (not sure how much of that is what's already in)
    Infraware       (these come bundled with resources and require lots of rewriting)
    Intel           (need to check how much overlap there is with existing stuff)
    Microsoft       (lots of things, need to check overlap)
    Ms2ger          (Ms2ger is doing those)
    Opera           (split into multiple PRs)
