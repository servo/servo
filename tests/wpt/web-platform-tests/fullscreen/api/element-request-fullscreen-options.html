// Tests for https://github.com/whatwg/fullscreen/pull/129. Because there are
// no normative requirements on what navigationUI should do, just test for
// basic support. (One could also check that the three allowed enum valid are
// supported and no others, but that would overlap with UA-specific tests.)
