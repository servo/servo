# The vast majority of tests rely on files located within the `resources`
# directory. Because of this, modifications to that directory's contents have
# the potential to introduce instability in a large number of tests.
# Exhaustively validating such changes is highly resource intensive
# (particularly in terms of execution time), making it impractical in most
# cases.
