Need tests for (likely not a complete list):

* All generateBid() and scoreAd() input parameters.

    with no buyers).
* Interest group expiration.
* Multiple buyers.
* Multiple interest group with same owner.
* Multiple origin auctions (buyer != publisher != seller).
* Multiple frame tests (including join IG policy, run auction policy,
    loading URNs in fencedframes in other frames, loading component
    ad URNs in fenced frames of other frames, etc)
* adAuctionConfig passed to reportResult().
* trusted bidding / scoring signals.
* Component ads.
* Component auctions.
* In reporting methods, browserSignals fields: dataVersion, topLevelSeller,
    componentSeller, modifiedBid, adCost, madeHighestScoringOtherBid
    (with interest group from another origin).
* Loading ads in iframes.
* In fencedframes window.fence.setReportEventDataForAutomaticBeacons()
* Calling leaveAdInterestGroup() in the frame of a winning ad (and one
    of its component ads)
* Network timeouts.

If possible:
* Aggregate reporting.
* Join/leave permission delegation via .well-known files.
* k-anonymity.
