# This file implements a shared lock that lets us ensure that the test cases in
# this directory run serially.  Each test case obtains this lock as its first
# step, and releases it as its last.  (The nel_test helper function in
# nel.sub.js automates this process.)  Because the lock needs to be shared
# across all of the test cases, we use a hard-coded stash key.  This hard-coded
# key is a random UUID, which should not conflict with any other auto-generated
# stash keys.
