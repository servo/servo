    TODO
      5.2.  replaceTrack
        To avoid track identifiers changing on the remote receiving end when
        a track is replaced, the sender must retain the original track
        identifier and stream associations and use these in subsequent
        negotiations.

    Non-Testable
      5.2.  replaceTrack
        10. Run the following steps in parallel:
            1.  Determine if negotiation is needed to transmit withTrack in place
                of the sender's existing track.

                Ignore which MediaStream the track resides in and the id attribute
                of the track in this determination.

                If negotiation is needed, then reject p with a newly created
                InvalidModificationError and abort these steps.

            2.  If withTrack is null, have the sender stop sending, without
                negotiating. Otherwise, have the sender switch seamlessly to
                transmitting withTrack instead of the sender's existing track,
                without negotiating.
            3.  Queue a task that runs the following steps:
              1.  If connection's [[isClosed]] slot is true, abort these steps.
