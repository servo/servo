      5.1.  addTransceiver
        - Adding a transceiver will cause future calls to createOffer to add a media
          description for the corresponding transceiver, as defined in [JSEP]
          (section 5.2.2.).

        - Setting a new RTCSessionDescription may change mid to a non-null value,
          as defined in [JSEP] (section 5.5. and section 5.6.).

        1.  If the dictionary argument is present, and it has a streams member, let
            streams be that list of MediaStream objects.

      5.2.  RTCRtpSender Interface
        Create an RTCRtpSender
          3.  Let sender have an [[associated MediaStreams]] internal slot, representing
              a list of MediaStream objects that the MediaStreamTrack object of this
              sender is associated with.

          4.  Set sender's [[associated MediaStreams]] slot to streams.

          5.  Let sender have a [[send encodings]] internal slot, representing a list
              of RTCRtpEncodingParameters dictionaries.

          6.  If sendEncodings is given as input to this algorithm, and is non-empty,
              set the [[send encodings]] slot to sendEncodings. Otherwise, set it to a
              list containing a single RTCRtpEncodingParameters with active set to true.

      5.3.  RTCRtpReceiver Interface
        Create an RTCRtpReceiver
          4.  If an id string, id, was given as input to this algorithm, initialize
              track.id to id. (Otherwise the value generated when track was created
              will be used.)

    Tested in RTCPeerConnection-onnegotiationneeded.html
      5.1.  addTransceiver
        12. Update the negotiation-needed flag for connection.

    Out of Scope
      5.1.  addTransceiver
        8.  If sendEncodings is set, then subsequent calls to createOffer will be
            configured to send multiple RTP encodings as defined in [JSEP]
            (section 5.2.2. and section 5.2.1.).

            When setRemoteDescription is called with a corresponding remote
            description that is able to receive multiple RTP encodings as defined
            in [JSEP] (section 3.7.), the RTCRtpSender may send multiple RTP
            encodings and the parameters retrieved via the transceiver's
            sender.getParameters() will reflect the encodings negotiated.

        9.  This specification does not define how to configure createOffer to
            receive multiple RTP encodings. However when setRemoteDescription is
            called with a corresponding remote description that is able to send
            multiple RTP encodings as defined in [JSEP], the RTCRtpReceiver may
            receive multiple RTP encodings and the parameters retrieved via the
            transceiver's receiver.getParameters() will reflect the encodings
            negotiated.
