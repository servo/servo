  /*
   *  TODO
   *  4.3.2 createAnswer
   *    3.  If connection is configured with an identity provider, and an
   *        identity assertion has not yet been generated using said
   *        identity provider, then begin the identity assertion request
   *        process if it has not already begun.
   *
   *    Steps to create an answer
   *      1.  If the need for an identity assertion was identified when
   *          createAnswer was invoked, wait for the identity assertion
   *          request process to complete.
   *      2.  If the identity provider was unable to produce an identity
   *          assertion, reject p with a newly created NotReadableError
   *          and abort these steps.
   *      3.  If connection was not constructed with a set of certificates,
   *          and one has not yet been generated, wait for it to be generated.
   *
   *    Final steps to create an answer
   *      2.  If connection was modified in such a way that additional
   *          inspection of the system state is necessary, then in
   *          parallel begin the steps to create an answer again, given p,
   *          and abort these steps.
   *
   *  Non-Testable
   *  4.3.2 createAnswer
   *      Steps to create an answer
   *        4.  Inspect the system state to determine the currently
   *            available resources as necessary for generating the answer,
   *            as described in [JSEP] (section 4.1.7.).
   *        5.  If this inspection failed for any reason, reject p with a
   *            newly created OperationError and abort these steps.
   *
   *      Final steps to create an answer
   *        3.  Given the information that was obtained from previous inspection
   *            and the current state of connection and its RTCRtpTransceivers,
   *            generate an SDP answer, sdpString, as described in [JSEP] (section 5.3.).
