   *            2.  Let track be null.
   *        5.  Create an RTCRtpSender with track, streams and sendEncodings and let sender
   *            be the result.
   *        6.  Create an RTCRtpReceiver with kind and let receiver be the result.
   *        7.  Create an RTCRtpTransceiver with sender and receiver and let transceiver
   *            be the result.
   *        8.  Add transceiver to connection's set of transceivers.
   *
   *  5.3.  RTCRtpReceiver Interface
   *        Create an RTCRtpReceiver
   *        2.  Let track be a new MediaStreamTrack object [GETUSERMEDIA]. The source of
   *            track is a remote source provided by receiver.
   *        3.  Initialize track.kind to kind.
   *        5.  Initialize track.label to the result of concatenating the string "remote "
   *            with kind.
   *        6.  Initialize track.readyState to live.
   *        7.  Initialize track.muted to true.
   *
   *  5.4.  RTCRtpTransceiver Interface
   *        Create an RTCRtpTransceiver
   *        2.  Set transceiver.sender to sender.
   *        3.  Set transceiver.receiver to receiver.
   *        4.  Set transceiver.stopped to false.
