    4.3.1.6.  Set the RTCSessionSessionDescription
      8.  If description is set as a remote description, then run the following steps
          for each media description in description:
        1.  As described by [JSEP] (section 5.9.), attempt to find an existing
            RTCRtpTransceiver object, transceiver, to represent the media description.
        3.  If the media description has no MID, and transceiver's mid is unset, generate
            a random value as described in [JSEP] (section 5.9.).
        4.  If the direction of the media description is sendrecv or sendonly, and
            transceiver.receiver.track has not yet been fired in a track event, process
            the remote track for the media description, given transceiver.
        5.  If the media description is rejected, and transceiver is not already stopped,
            stop the RTCRtpTransceiver transceiver.

    [JSEP]
    5.9.  Applying a Remote Description
      - If the m= section is not associated with any RtpTransceiver
        (possibly because it was dissociated in the previous step),
        either find an RtpTransceiver or create one according to the
        following steps:

        - If the m= section is sendrecv or recvonly, and there are
          RtpTransceivers of the same type that were added to the
          PeerConnection by addTrack and are not associated with any
          m= section and are not stopped, find the first (according to
          the canonical order described in Section 5.2.1) such
          RtpTransceiver.

        - If no RtpTransceiver was found in the previous step, create
          one with a recvonly direction.
