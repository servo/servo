        the other ways do not, allowing the same MediaStreamTrack to be sent
        several times simultaneously.

          be reused.

          If any RTCRtpSender object in senders matches all the following
          criteria, let sender be that object, or null otherwise:
            - The sender's track is null.
            - The transceiver kind of the RTCRtpTransceiver, associated with
              the sender, matches track's kind.
            - The sender has never been used to send. More precisely, the
              RTCRtpTransceiver associated with the sender has never had a
              currentDirection of sendrecv or sendonly.
      7.  If sender is not null, run the following steps to use that sender:
          1.  Set sender.track to track.
          3.  Enable sending direction on the RTCRtpTransceiver associated
              with sender.

            method's remaining arguments, or an empty list if the method was
            called with a single argument.
        6.  The steps below describe how to determine if an existing sender can
            be reused. Doing so will cause future calls to createOffer and
            createAnswer to mark the corresponding media description as sendrecv
            or sendonly and add the MSID of the track added, as defined in [JSEP]
            (section 5.2.2. and section 5.3.2.).
        9.  A track could have contents that are inaccessible to the application.
            This can be due to being marked with a peerIdentity option or anything
            that would make a track CORS cross-origin. These tracks can be supplied
            to the addTrack method, and have an RTCRtpSender created for them, but
            content must not be transmitted, unless they are also marked with
            peerIdentity and they meet the requirements for sending (see isolated
            streams and RTCPeerConnection).

            All other tracks that are not accessible to the application must not be
            sent to the peer, with silence (audio), black frames (video) or
            equivalently absent content being sent in place of track content.

            Note that this property can change over time.
