      checking
        Any of the RTCIceTransport s are in the checking state and none of
        them are in the failed or disconnected state.

      connected
        All RTCIceTransport s are in the connected, completed or closed state
        and at least one of them is in the connected state.

      completed
        All RTCIceTransport s are in the completed or closed state and at least
        one of them is in the completed state.

      checking
        The RTCIceTransport has received at least one remote candidate and
        is checking candidate pairs and has either not yet found a connection
        or consent checks [RFC7675] have failed on all previously successful
        candidate pairs. In addition to checking, it may also still be gathering.

    5.6.  enum RTCIceTransportState
      connected
        The RTCIceTransport has found a usable connection, but is still
        checking other candidate pairs to see if there is a better connection.
        It may also still be gathering and/or waiting for additional remote
        candidates. If consent checks [RFC7675] fail on the connection in use,
        and there are no other successful candidate pairs available, then the
        state transitions to "checking" (if there are candidate pairs remaining
        to be checked) or "disconnected" (if there are no candidate pairs to
        check, but the peer is still gathering and/or waiting for additional
        remote candidates).

      completed
        The RTCIceTransport has finished gathering, received an indication that
        there are no more remote candidates, finished checking all candidate
        pairs and found a connection. If consent checks [RFC7675] subsequently
        fail on all successful candidate pairs, the state transitions to "failed".

      failed
        Any of the RTCIceTransport s are in the failed state.

      disconnected
        Any of the RTCIceTransport s are in the disconnected state and none of
        them are in the failed state.

      closed
        The RTCPeerConnection object's [[ isClosed]] slot is true.

    5.6.  enum RTCIceTransportState
      new
        The RTCIceTransport is gathering candidates and/or waiting for
        remote candidates to be supplied, and has not yet started checking.

      failed
        The RTCIceTransport has finished gathering, received an indication that
        there are no more remote candidates, finished checking all candidate pairs,
        and all pairs have either failed connectivity checks or have lost consent.

      disconnected
        The ICE Agent has determined that connectivity is currently lost for this
        RTCIceTransport . This is more aggressive than failed, and may trigger
        intermittently (and resolve itself without action) on a flaky network.
        The way this state is determined is implementation dependent.

        Examples include:
          Losing the network interface for the connection in use.
          Repeatedly failing to receive a response to STUN requests.

        Alternatively, the RTCIceTransport has finished checking all existing
        candidates pairs and failed to find a connection (or consent checks
        [RFC7675] once successful, have now failed), but it is still gathering
        and/or waiting for additional remote candidates.

      closed
        The RTCIceTransport has shut down and is no longer responding to STUN requests.
