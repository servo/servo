class Stash:
    """Key-value store for persisting data across HTTP/S and WS/S requests.

    This data store is specifically designed for persisting data across server
    requests. The synchronization is achieved by using the BaseManager from
    the multiprocessing module so different processes can acccess the same data.

    Stash can be used interchangeably between HTTP, HTTPS, WS and WSS servers.
    A thing to note about WS/S servers is that they require additional steps in
    the handlers for accessing the same underlying shared data in the Stash.
    This can usually be achieved by using load_env_config(). When using Stash
    interchangeably between HTTP/S and WS/S request, the path part of the key
    should be expliclitly specified if accessing the same key/value subset.

    The store has several unusual properties. Keys are of the form (path,
    uuid), where path is, by default, the path in the HTTP request and
    uuid is a unique id. In addition, the store is write-once, read-once,
    i.e. the value associated with a particular key cannot be changed once
    written and the read operation (called "take") is destructive. Taken together,
    these properties make it difficult for data to accidentally leak
    between different resources or different requests for the same
    resource.
