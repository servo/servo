The py lib is a Python development support library featuring
the following tools and modules:

* py.path:  uniform local and svn path objects
* py.apipkg:  explicit API control and lazy-importing
* py.iniconfig:  easy parsing of .ini files
* py.code: dynamic code generation and introspection

NOTE: prior to the 1.4 release this distribution used to
contain py.test which is now its own package, see http://pytest.org
