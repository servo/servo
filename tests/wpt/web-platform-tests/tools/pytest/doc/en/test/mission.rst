Mission
====================================

``pytest`` strives to make testing a fun and no-boilerplate effort.

The tool is distributed as a `pytest` package.  Its project independent
``py.test`` command line tool helps you to:

* rapidly collect and run tests
* run unit- or doctests, functional or integration tests
* distribute tests to multiple environments
* use local or global plugins for custom test types and setup
