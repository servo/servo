Thanks for submitting a PR, your contribution is really appreciated!

Here's a quick checklist that should be present in PRs:

- [ ] Target: for bug or doc fixes, target `master`; for new features, target `features`
- [ ] Make sure to include one or more tests for your change
- [ ] Add yourself to `AUTHORS`
- [ ] Add a new entry to the `CHANGELOG` (choose any open position to avoid merge conflicts with other PRs)
