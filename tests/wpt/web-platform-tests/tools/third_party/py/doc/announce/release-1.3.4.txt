py.test/pylib 1.3.4: fixes and new native traceback option
===========================================================================

pylib/py.test 1.3.4 is a minor maintenance release mostly containing bug fixes
and a new "--tb=native" traceback option to show "normal" Python standard
tracebacks instead of the py.test enhanced tracebacks.  See below for more
change info and http://pytest.org for more general information on features
and configuration of the testing tool.

Thanks to the issue reporters and generally to Ronny Pfannschmidt for help.

cheers,
