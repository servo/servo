        Six is a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library.  It provides utility functions
        for smoothing over the differences between the Python versions with the goal of
        writing Python code that is compatible on both Python versions.  See the
        documentation for more information on what is provided.
        
        Six supports every Python version since 2.6.  It is contained in only one Python
        file, so it can be easily copied into your project. (The copyright and license
        notice must be retained.)
        
        Online documentation is at http://six.rtfd.org.

        be found there.
