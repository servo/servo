pytest: helps you write better programs
=======================================


The ``pytest`` framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet
scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

An example of a simple test:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of test_sample.py
    def inc(x):
        return x + 1

    def test_answer():
        assert inc(3) == 5


To execute it::

    $ pytest
    =========================== test session starts ============================
    platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-3.x.y, py-1.x.y, pluggy-0.x.y
    rootdir: $REGENDOC_TMPDIR, inifile:
    collected 1 item
    
    test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]
    
    ================================= FAILURES =================================
    _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________
    
        def test_answer():
    >       assert inc(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = inc(3)
    
    test_sample.py:5: AssertionError
    ========================= 1 failed in 0.12 seconds =========================

Due to ``pytest``'s detailed assertion introspection, only plain ``assert`` statements are used.
See :ref:`Getting Started <getstarted>` for more examples.
