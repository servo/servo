Skip and xfail: dealing with tests that cannot succeed
======================================================

You can mark test functions that cannot be run on certain platforms
or that you expect to fail so pytest can deal with them accordingly and
present a summary of the test session, while keeping the test suite *green*.

A **skip** means that you expect your test to pass only if some conditions are met,
otherwise pytest should skip running the test altogether. Common examples are skipping
windows-only tests on non-windows platforms, or skipping tests that depend on an external
resource which is not available at the moment (for example a database).

A **xfail** means that you expect a test to fail for some reason.
A common example is a test for a feature not yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed.
When a test passes despite being expected to fail (marked with ``pytest.mark.xfail``),
it's an **xpass** and will be reported in the test summary.

``pytest`` counts and lists *skip* and *xfail* tests separately. Detailed
information about skipped/xfailed tests is not shown by default to avoid
cluttering the output.  You can use the ``-r`` option to see details
corresponding to the "short" letters shown in the test progress::

    pytest -rxXs  # show extra info on xfailed, xpassed, and skipped tests

More details on the ``-r`` option can be found by running ``pytest -h``.

Skipping test functions
-----------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.9

The simplest way to skip a test function is to mark it with the ``skip`` decorator
which may be passed an optional ``reason``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.skip(reason="no way of currently testing this")
    def test_the_unknown():
        ...


Alternatively, it is also possible to skip imperatively during test execution or setup
by calling the ``pytest.skip(reason)`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function():
        if not valid_config():
            pytest.skip("unsupported configuration")

It is also possible to skip the whole module using
``pytest.skip(reason, allow_module_level=True)`` at the module level:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest

    if not pytest.config.getoption("--custom-flag"):
        pytest.skip("--custom-flag is missing, skipping tests", allow_module_level=True)

The imperative method is useful when it is not possible to evaluate the skip condition
during import time.

``skipif``
~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.0

If you wish to skip something conditionally then you can use ``skipif`` instead.
Here is an example of marking a test function to be skipped
when run on a Python3.6 interpreter::

    import sys
    @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (3,6),
                        reason="requires python3.6")
    def test_function():
        ...

If the condition evaluates to ``True`` during collection, the test function will be skipped,
with the specified reason appearing in the summary when using ``-rs``.

You can share ``skipif`` markers between modules.  Consider this test module::

    # content of test_mymodule.py
    import mymodule
    minversion = pytest.mark.skipif(mymodule.__versioninfo__ < (1,1),
                                    reason="at least mymodule-1.1 required")
    @minversion
    def test_function():
        ...

You can import the marker and reuse it in another test module::

    # test_myothermodule.py
    from test_mymodule import minversion

    @minversion
    def test_anotherfunction():
        ...

For larger test suites it's usually a good idea to have one file
where you define the markers which you then consistently apply
throughout your test suite.

Alternatively, you can use :ref:`condition strings
<string conditions>` instead of booleans, but they can't be shared between modules easily
so they are supported mainly for backward compatibility reasons.


Skip all test functions of a class or module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``skipif`` marker (as any other marker) on classes::

    @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == 'win32',
                        reason="does not run on windows")
    class TestPosixCalls(object):

        def test_function(self):
            "will not be setup or run under 'win32' platform"

If the condition is ``True``, this marker will produce a skip result for
each of the test methods of that class.

.. warning::

   The use of ``skipif`` on classes that use inheritance is strongly
   discouraged. `A Known bug <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/568>`_
   in pytest's markers may cause unexpected behavior in super classes.

If you want to skip all test functions of a module, you may use
the ``pytestmark`` name on the global level:

.. code-block:: python

    # test_module.py
    pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)

If multiple ``skipif`` decorators are applied to a test function, it
will be skipped if any of the skip conditions is true.

.. _`whole class- or module level`: mark.html#scoped-marking


Skipping files or directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you may need to skip an entire file or directory, for example if the
tests rely on Python version-specific features or contain code that you do not
wish pytest to run. In this case, you must exclude the files and directories
from collection. Refer to :ref:`customizing-test-collection` for more
information.


Skipping on a missing import dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the following helper at module level
or within a test or test setup function::

    docutils = pytest.importorskip("docutils")

If ``docutils`` cannot be imported here, this will lead to a
skip outcome of the test.  You can also skip based on the
version number of a library::

    docutils = pytest.importorskip("docutils", minversion="0.3")

The version will be read from the specified
module's ``__version__`` attribute.

Summary
~~~~~~~

Here's a quick guide on how to skip tests in a module in different situations:

1. Skip all tests in a module unconditionally:

  .. code-block:: python

        pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip('all tests still WIP')

2. Skip all tests in a module based on some condition:

  .. code-block:: python

        pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == 'win32', 'tests for linux only')

3. Skip all tests in a module if some import is missing:

  .. code-block:: python

        pexpect = pytest.importorskip('pexpect')


.. _xfail:

XFail: mark test functions as expected to fail
----------------------------------------------

You can use the ``xfail`` marker to indicate that you
expect a test to fail::

    @pytest.mark.xfail
    def test_function():
        ...

This test will be run but no traceback will be reported
when it fails. Instead terminal reporting will list it in the
"expected to fail" (``XFAIL``) or "unexpectedly passing" (``XPASS``) sections.

Alternatively, you can also mark a test as ``XFAIL`` from within a test or setup function
imperatively:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_function():
        if not valid_config():
            pytest.xfail("failing configuration (but should work)")

This will unconditionally make ``test_function`` ``XFAIL``. Note that no other code is executed
after ``pytest.xfail`` call, differently from the marker. That's because it is implemented
internally by raising a known exception.

Here's the signature of the ``xfail`` **marker** (not the function), using Python 3 keyword-only
arguments syntax:

.. code-block:: python

    def xfail(condition=None, *, reason=None, raises=None, run=True, strict=False):




``strict`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 2.9

Both ``XFAIL`` and ``XPASS`` don't fail the test suite, unless the ``strict`` keyword-only
parameter is passed as ``True``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)
    def test_function():
        ...


This will make ``XPASS`` ("unexpectedly passing") results from this test to fail the test suite.

You can change the default value of the ``strict`` parameter using the
``xfail_strict`` ini option:

.. code-block:: ini

    [pytest]
    xfail_strict=true


``reason`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with skipif_ you can also mark your expectation of a failure
on a particular platform::

    @pytest.mark.xfail(sys.version_info >= (3,6),
                       reason="python3.6 api changes")
    def test_function():
        ...


``raises`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to be more specific as to why the test is failing, you can specify
a single exception, or a list of exceptions, in the ``raises`` argument.

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=RuntimeError)
    def test_function():
        ...

Then the test will be reported as a regular failure if it fails with an
exception not mentioned in ``raises``.

``run`` parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a test should be marked as xfail and reported as such but should not be
even executed, use the ``run`` parameter as ``False``:

.. code-block:: python

    @pytest.mark.xfail(run=False)
    def test_function():
        ...

This is specially useful for xfailing tests that are crashing the interpreter and should be
investigated later.


Ignoring xfail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By specifying on the commandline::

    pytest --runxfail

you can force the running and reporting of an ``xfail`` marked test
as if it weren't marked at all. This also causes ``pytest.xfail`` to produce no effect.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Here is a simple test file with the several usages:

.. literalinclude:: example/xfail_demo.py

Running it with the report-on-xfail option gives this output::

    example $ pytest -rx xfail_demo.py

Skip/xfail with parametrize
---------------------------

It is possible to apply markers like skip and xfail to individual
test instances when using parametrize:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest

    @pytest.mark.parametrize(("n", "expected"), [
        (1, 2),
    pytest.param(1, 0, marks=pytest.mark.xfail),
	pytest.param(1, 3, marks=pytest.mark.xfail(reason="some bug")),
        (2, 3),
        (3, 4),
        (4, 5),
    pytest.param(10, 11, marks=pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info >= (3, 0), reason="py2k")),
    ])
    def test_increment(n, expected):
        assert n + 1 == expected
