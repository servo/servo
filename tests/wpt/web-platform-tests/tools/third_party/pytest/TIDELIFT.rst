Tidelift
========

pytest is a member of `Tidelift`_. This document describes how the core team manages
Tidelift-related activities.

What is it
==========

Tidelift aims to make Open Source sustainable by offering subscriptions to companies which rely
on Open Source packages. This subscription allows it to pay maintainers of those Open Source
packages to aid sustainability of the work.

It is the perfect platform for companies that want to support Open Source packages and at the same
time obtain assurances regarding maintenance, quality and security.

Funds
=====

It was decided in the `mailing list`_ that the Tidelift contribution will be split evenly between
members of the `contributors team`_ interested in receiving funding.

The current list of contributors receiving funding are:

* `@asottile`_
* `@nicoddemus`_
* `@The-Compiler`_

Contributors interested in receiving a part of the funds just need to submit a PR adding their
name to the list. Contributors that want to stop receiving the funds should also submit a PR
in the same way.

The PR should mention `@pytest-dev/tidelift-admins`_ so appropriate changes
can be made in the Tidelift platform.

After the PR has been accepted and merged, the contributor should register in the `Tidelift`_
platform and follow the instructions there, including signing an `agreement`_.

Admins
======

A few people have admin access to the Tidelift dashboard to make changes. Those people
are part of the `@pytest-dev/tidelift-admins`_ team.

`Core contributors`_ interested in helping out with Tidelift maintenance are welcome! We don't
expect much work here other than the occasional adding/removal of a contributor from receiving
funds. Just drop a line to one of the `@pytest-dev/tidelift-admins`_ or use the mailing list.
