Tests for the [Reporting API](https://w3c.github.io/reporting/).

The tests in this directory validate the generic functionaity of the Reporting
API. Since reports are not actually generated by that specification, these tests
occasionally make use of other integrations, like CSP or Permissions Policy.

## Testing integration with the Reporting API

More comprehensive tests for other specifications' generated reports should be
in those specs' respective directories.

There are two general methods of testing reporting integration:

* The simpler is with the ReportingObserver interface, generating reports
  within a document and reading them from script running in that document.
* For reports which cannot be observed from a document, there is a reporting
  collector provided which can receive reports sent over HTTP and then serve
  them in response to queries from the test script. See resources/README.md for
  details.
