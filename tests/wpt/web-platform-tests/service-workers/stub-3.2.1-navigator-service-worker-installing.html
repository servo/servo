`navigator.serviceWorker.installing` must return a [ServiceWorker][1] object
representing the [installing worker][2] that is currently undergoing the
installation process (from step 1 to step 7 of the [_Installation
algorithm][3]) for the given [URL scope][4] in which the document may be
[controlled][5] when the Service Worker becomes the [active worker][6].
`navigator.serviceWorker.installing` returns `null` if no Service Worker
[registration][7] is in the [installation process][8].
