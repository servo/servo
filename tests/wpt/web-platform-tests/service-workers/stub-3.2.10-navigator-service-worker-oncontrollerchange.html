<!--

`navigator.serviceWorker.oncontrollerchange` is the [event handler][1] that
must be supported as attribute by the `[ServiceWorkerContainer][2]` object. A
`controllerchange` event using the `[Event][3]` interface is dispatched on
`[ServiceWorkerContainer][2]` object (See step 7 of the [_Activation
algorithm][4]) when the associated Service Worker [registration][5] for the
document enters the [activation process][6]. When the [activation process][6]
is triggered by `replace()` method call within the event handler of the
`install` event, `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` immediately reflects the
[active worker][7] as the Service Worker that [controls][8] the document.
