`navigator.serviceWorker.onreloadpage` is the [event handler][1] that must be
supported as attribute by the `[ServiceWorkerContainer][2]` object. An event
named `reloadpage` using the `[ReloadPageEvent][3]` interface is dispatched on
`[ServiceWorkerContainer][2]` object when the page reload is triggered by the
`[self.clients.reloadAll()][4]` method call from the [active worker][5],
represented by its associated [ServiceWorkerGlobalScope][6] object, for the
document.
