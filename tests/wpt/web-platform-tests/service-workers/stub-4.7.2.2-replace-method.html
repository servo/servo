`replace()` interacts with `waitUntil` method in the following way:

-   Successful installation can be delayed by `waitUntil`, perhaps by
    subsequent event handlers.
-   Replacement only happens upon successful installation
-   Therefore, replacement of the [active worker][1] (if any) is not
    immediate, however it may occur as soon as the end of the current turn.
