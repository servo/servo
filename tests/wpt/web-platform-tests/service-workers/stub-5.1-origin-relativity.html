One of the advanced concerns that major applications would encounter is whether
they can be hosted from a CDN. By definition, these are servers in other
places, often on other domains. Therefore, Service Workers cannot be hosted on
CDNs. But they can include resources via [importScripts()][1]. The reason for
this restriction is that Service Workers create the opportunity for a bad actor
to turn a bad day into a bad eternity.
