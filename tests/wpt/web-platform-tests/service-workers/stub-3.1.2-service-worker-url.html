<!--

The `url` attribute must return the [serialization][1] of the URL of the script
of the Service Worker, identified by its [URL scope][2], that is associated
with the [ServiceWorkerGlobalScope][3] object. The `url` attribute is always an
[absolute URL][4] corresponding to the script file which the Service Worker
evaluates.

In the example in section 3.1.1, the value of
`navigator.serviceWorker.controller.url` will be
`"https://example.com/service_worker.js"`.
