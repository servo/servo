To allow authors to fully manage their content caches for offline use, the
`[ServiceWorkerGlobalScope][1]` execution context provides the caching methods
largely conforming to [ECMAScript 6 Map objects][2] with additional convenience
methods. A domain can have multiple, named `[Cache][3]` objects, whose contents
are entirely under the control of scripts. Caches are not shared across
domains, and they are completely isolated from the browser's HTTP cache.
