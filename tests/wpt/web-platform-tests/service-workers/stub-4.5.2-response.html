<!--

`Response` objects are mutable and constructable. They model HTTP responses.
The `fetch()` API returns this type for same-origin responses.

It may be possible to set the `Location` header of a `Response` object to
someplace not in the current origin but this is not a security issue.
Cross-origin response bodies are opaque to script, and since only same-origin
documents will encounter these responses, the only systems the Service Worker
can "lie to" are same-origin (and therefore safe from the perspective of other
origins).
