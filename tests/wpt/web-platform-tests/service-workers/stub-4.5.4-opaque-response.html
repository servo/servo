<!--

`OpaqueResponse` objects are immutable but constructable. The `fetch()` API
returns this type for cross-origin responses.

Their role is to encapsulate the security properties of the web platform. As
such, their `body` attribute will always be `undefined` and the list of
readable `headers` is heavily filtered.

`OpaqueResponse` objects may be forwarded on to rendering documents in exactly
the same way as mutable `Response` objects.
