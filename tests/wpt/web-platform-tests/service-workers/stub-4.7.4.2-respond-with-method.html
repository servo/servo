<!--

`event.respondWith(r)` method must run the steps, from step 10 to step 15,
defined in the [_OnFetchRequest algorithm][1].

The `r` argument must resolve with a [AbstractResponse][2], else a
[NetworkError][3] is thrown. If the request is a top-level navigation and the
return value is a [OpaqueResponse][4] (an opaque response body), a
[NetworkError][3] is thrown. The final URL of all successful (non
network-error) responses is the [requested][5] URL. Renderer-side security
checks about tainting for cross-origin content are tied to the transparency (or
opacity) of the [Response][6] body, not URLs.
