<!--

The `[Cache][1]` instances are not part of the browser's HTTP cache. The
`[Cache][1]` objects are exactly what authors have to manage themselves. The
`[Cache][1]` objects do not get updated unless authors explicitly request them
to be. The `[Cache][1]` objects do not expire unless authors delete the
entries. The `[Cache][1]` objects do not disappear just because the Service
Worker script is updated. That is, caches are not updated automatically.
Updates must be manually managed. This implies that authors should version
their caches by name and make sure to use the caches only from the version of
the ServiceWorker that can safely operate on.
