<!--

The `scope` of a `ServiceWorker` object reflects the [URL scope][1] of the
associated Service Worker [registration][2]. The `scope` attribute must return
the [serialization][3] of the URL representing the [URL scope][1] of the
associated Service Worker [registration][2].

For example, consider a document created by a navigation to
`https://example.com/app.html` which [matches][4] via the following
registration call which has been previously executed:
// Script on the page https://example.com/app.html
navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service_worker.js", { scope: "/*" });
The value of `navigator.serviceWorker.controller.scope` will be
`"https://example.com/*"`.
