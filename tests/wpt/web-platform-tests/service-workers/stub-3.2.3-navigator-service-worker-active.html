`navigator.serviceWorker.active` must return a [ServiceWorker][1] object
representing the [active worker][2] that is currently undergoing or completed
the activation process (from step 4 to step 9 of the [_Activation
algorithm][3]) for the given [URL scope][4] in which the document is controlled
(or to be controlled). `navigator.serviceWorker.active` returns `null` if no
Service Worker [registration][5] is in the [activation process][6].
