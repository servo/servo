// This tests service worker interception for worker clients, when the request
// for the worker script goes through redirects. For example, a request can go
// through a chain of URLs like A -> B -> C -> D and each URL might fall in the
// scope of a different service worker, if any.
// The two key questions are:
// 1. Upon a redirect from A -> B, should a service worker for scope B
//    intercept the request?
// 2. After the final response, which service worker controls the resulting
//    client?
//
// The standard prescribes the following:
// 1. The service worker for scope B intercepts the redirect. *However*, once a
//    request falls back to network (i.e., a service worker did not call
//    respondWith()) and a redirect is then received from network, no service
//    worker should intercept that redirect or any subsequent redirects.
// 2. The final service worker that got a fetch event (or would have, in the
//    case of a non-fetch-event worker) becomes the controller of the client.
//
// The standard may change later, see:
// https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1289
//
// The basic test setup is:
// 1. Page registers service workers for scope1 and scope2.
// 2. Page requests a worker from scope1.
// 3. The request is redirected to scope2 or out-of-scope.
// 4. The worker posts message to the page describing where the final response
//   was served from (service worker or network).
// 5. The worker does an importScripts() and fetch(), and posts back the
//   responses, which describe where the responses where served from.
//
// Currently this only tests shared worker but dedicated worker tests should be
// added in a future patch.

// Globals for easier cleanup.
