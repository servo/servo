  <meta name="assert" content="An HTML 4 textarea must be focused in order to enter text into it. The :focus pseudo-class applies to a textarea while it has the focus (accepts keyboard events or other forms of text input)." />

  <style type="text/css"><![CDATA[
  span
  {
  color: white;
  font-size: 150%;
  }

  textarea:focus + span
  {
  color: green;
  }
  ]]></style>

 <body>

  <p>Enter in the text field below with the pointing device or with the keyboard (with the tab key or with the "T" accesskey) and then enter some text into it. A message in green should then have appeared on its right-hand side indicating that such text field has received focus. In order to pass this test, the tester should not have to move the pointing device outside the text field.</p>

  <div>
   <textarea cols="32" rows="4" accesskey="T" tabindex="1"></textarea> <span>Focus received by text field</span>
  </div>
