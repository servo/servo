2. Find all declarations that apply to the element/property in question.
Declarations apply if the selector matches the element in question.
</ul>

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should be blue.
The background should be lime.
All text above this paragraph should be red.
The rules applied are "p {color: blue}", "BODY {background-color: lime}",
and "HTML {color: red}".  These are all the declarations that apply to the
"color" property (as an example) or the elements P, BODY, and HTML.  The
selectors match the elements in question above in the source.  All other
properties are inherited (or UA-default) since no declarations apply to
them.  For "HTML" and "background-color" above, the initial values are
used.
