PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>

If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have a bottom margin
of 0.
The rule applied is "p {margin-bottom: }".
So the margin-bottom property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a margin bottom of 2em
<em>
This emphasized text should have a margin bottom of UA-default, since the 
margin bottom property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {margin-bottom: 2em}".
So the margin bottom property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a margin bottom which is 4em.
The rule applied is "margin-bottom: 4em".
So the margin bottom property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a margin bottom of 6em
; so the margin bottom property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {margin-bottom: 6em}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a margin bottom of 50% of that
of its parent (body element).
The rule applied is "blockquote {margin-bottom: 50%}", which should be
