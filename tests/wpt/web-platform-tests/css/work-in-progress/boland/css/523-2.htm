<h1 >Testing Statement #2 Below of Section 5.2.3 of CSS1 Spec</h1>
<ul>
<li>
2. For "font-style", initial is "normal", it applies to all elements, it is
inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>

<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<blockquote>
If statement #2 above is passed, then
this blockquote should have font style of normal.  No font-style CSS1 rules
are applied, which means that UA-default (initial?) value is normal.
</blockquote>

<p >
This font style should be italic for this "p" element, which means that
font style applies to this element.
The rule applied is "p {font-style: italic}".

<h3 >
The font style of this h3 heading should be italic, which means that
font style applies to this h3 element.
The rule applied is "h3 {font-style: italic}".
</h3>

<h4 >
This <em>word(em)</em> should be oblique font style, along with the rest
of this h4 heading, since "em" inherits from h4.
The rule applied is "h4 {font-style: oblique}".
Font style applies to the "em" element.
</h4>
<h4 >
The word <strong>strong</strong> is this h4 heading is "strong", and so
should have a normal font style; the rest of the heading should have an
oblique font style.
The rules applied are "h4 {font-style: oblique}", and
"strong {font-style: normal}".
</h4>
<p ID=id1>
Below is all "p", which should be UA-default, since the nonsensical rule
"#id1 {font-style: 200%}" is indicated, but percentages are not applicable.
This paragraph could be italic as well?
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
