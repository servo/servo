<h1>Testing Statement #8 Below of Section 5.6.1 of CSS1 Spec</h1>

elements and the surrounding box.

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
This paragraph should not be seen.
<em>This emphasized text should not be seen.</em>
The rest of this paragraph should also not be seen.
</p>
<h3>
If statement #8 above is passed, then nothing should be seen above this and
below "PASS CRITERIA", because of the rule "p {display: none}", even though
there is a p element (with child em element) in the HTML source above.


All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
