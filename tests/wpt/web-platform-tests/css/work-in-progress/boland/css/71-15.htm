characters 161-255, plus dash; they cannot start with a dash or a digit; they
can also contain escaped characters and any Unicode character as a numeric
code.
</ul>




<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p CLASS=RED-RED>
If statement #15 above is passed, this paragraph should be red.
The rule applied is ".RED-RED {color: red}", where the CLASS name contains
a dash, and letters from A-Z (any maximum length?).
<p CLASS=-NEW>
This paragraph should be UA-default.  The rule stated is ".-NEW {color: aqua}"
 but the CLASS name has a dash in front, which is illegal.
So the rule should be ignored.
<p ID="b109">
This paragraph should be blue.  THe rule applied is "#b109 {color: blue}",
where the ID name has lowercase letter from a-z and digits from 0 to 9.
<p ID=99>
This paragraph should be purple.  The rule stated is "#99 {color:
purple}".
<h3>
This h3 heading should be silver.  The rule applied is "h3 {color: silver}",
where the element selector is legal (characters from a-z and digits from
0-9).
</h3>



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
