2. For "color", initial is UA specific, it applies to all elements, it is
inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #2 above is passed, then:
<p>
This paragraph should be aqua.  The rule applied is "p {color: aqua}", so
the color property applies to the element p.  This <strong>strong text
</strong> should also be aqua, since "strong" is a descendant of "p",
so the color property is inherited.  However, this <em>emphasized text</em>
shoudl be red, because of the rule "em {color: red}"; therefore, the color
property applies to the em and strong elements.

<h3>
This h3 element should be silver, because of the rule "h3 {color: silver}".
Therefore the color property applies to the h3 element.
</h3>
<h4>
This h4 element should be lime, because of the rule "h4 {color: lime}".
Therefore the color property applies to the h4 element.
</h4>

<blockquote>
This blockquote element has a UA-default, or UA-specific color, because no
specific CSS1 rule has been applied.
However, the color property does apply to the blockquote element.
</blockquote>
All other properties on this page should be UA-default.
