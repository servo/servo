<h1>Testing Statement #4 Below of Section 5.3.5 of CSS1 Spec</h1>





<li >
4. CSS1 core: UAs ,au treat "fixed" as "scroll".  However, it is recommended
they interpret "fixed" correctly, at least on the HTML and BODY elements, since
there is no way for an author to provide an image only for those browsers that
support "fixed".
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #4 above is true, this background for this page should
be a flag pattern which is fixed.
The rules applied are "body {background-image: url(flagbg.gif);
                             background-attachment: fixed;}".
Note that these rules are also repeated for the HTML element.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
