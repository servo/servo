<h2>PASS CRITERIA:

<p>
If statement #2 above is passed, then:
<p class=initial>
The first letter of this paragraph is red.  The rule applied is "P.initial:first-letter {color: red}".  All other properties are UA-default.
<p class=initial>
The first letter of this paragraph should also be red.  This paragraph, like the one above, has class of initial.  All paragraphs with class of initial should
have their first letters red.  All other properties should be UA-default.
<p>
This paragraph does not have class of initial, so all letters should be
UA-default.  All other properties should also be UA-default.  No other style
sheet rules are applied here.
