<h1 >Testing Statement #1 Below of Section 4.1.3 of CSS1 Spec</h1>



<p>
1. Elements with a "display" property value of "list-item" are formatted as
block-level elements but preceded by a label.  The type of label is determined
by the "list-style" property.



<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #1 above is passed, then:

<ul>
<li>
First list item comes first
<li>
Second list item comes second
</ul>
<ul class=compact>
<li>
First list item comes first
<li>
Second list item comes second
</ul>

The top two list items should be formatted differently than the bottom
two.
The "ul" rules applied above are as follows: "UL {list-style: outside}"
and "UL.compact {list-style: inside}" for the second list group.
