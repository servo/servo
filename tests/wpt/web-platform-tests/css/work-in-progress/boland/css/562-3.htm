3. The "white-space" property declares how whitespace inside the element is
handled: the normal way (where whitespace is collapsed), as pre (which behaves
like the "PRE" element in HTML), or as nowrap (where wrapping is done only
through "BR" elements).
</ul>






<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p ID=id1 >
If statement #3 above is passed, this paragraph should have whitespace
collapsed, even   though    there    is    a     lot    of    whitespace
in source.  The    rule   applied    is    "#id1 {white-space: normal}".
</p>
<pre>
This is a pre element.  No special CSS rules are applied here.
</pre>
<p ID=id2>
This paragraph should look like the pre element above (in terms of spacing).
The rule applied is "#id2 {white-space: pre}".
</p>
<p ID=id3>
This paragraph should go on and on, because there is not a wrap-around for this
paragraph; therefore, it just goes on and on and on and on without stopping
until a final period is reached at the end of the sentence.
</p>
The rule applied above is"#id3 {white-space: nowrap}".
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
