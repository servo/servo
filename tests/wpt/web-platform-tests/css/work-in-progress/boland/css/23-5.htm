<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #5 above is passed, then:
<p>
<em>All of this text is emphasized with the "em" element, which is not block
level, up to this point</em>.   The pseudo-element applied is "em:first-line
{font-style: small-caps}", which is ignored, since "em" is not block-level.
All properties of this paragraph are UA-default.
</p>
<h2>
The first line of this h2 element should be in small caps font style, since
the pseudo-element applied is "h2:first-line {font-style: small-caps}", and
"h2" is block-level; remaining properties are UA-default
</h2>
