<h1>Testing Statement #1 Below of Section 4.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>




<ul>
<li>
1. All elements have a "line-height" property that,
in principle, gives the total height of a line of text.  Space is added above and
below the text of the line to arrive at that line height.
</ul>




<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #1 above is passed, this paragraph should have 14pt line height.
The text of this paragraph should be 12pt, so an extra space of 2pt should be
added here (1pt above and 1pt below).  
The rules applied are "P {font-size: 12pt}" and "P {line-height: 14pt}".
All other properties should be UA-default.
