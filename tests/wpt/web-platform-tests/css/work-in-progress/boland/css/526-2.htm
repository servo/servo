<h1 >Testing Statement #2 Below of Section 5.2.6 of CSS1 Spec</h1>








<ul>
<li>
2. For "font-size", initial is "medium", it applies to all elements, it is
inherited, adn percentage values are relative to parent element's font size.
</ul>




<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #2 above is passed, then:

<blockquote>
This font size of this "blockquote" element is medium (initial or UA-default).
No explicit CSS1 rules are applied, but the font size property does apply
to the "blockquote" element.
</blockquote>

<h3>This h3 heading has a font size of 10pt; this <em>emphasized text</em>
within this heading also has font size of 10pt, since "em" inherits from
"h3".  Thus the font size property applies to the "em" and "h3" elements.
The rule applied is "h3 {font-size: 10pt}".
</h3>

<h4>
This h4 heading has a font size of 5 pt, but this <strong>strong</strong>
word has a font size of 2.5 pt.  Thus the font size property applies to the
"h4" and "strong" elements.
The rules applied are "h4 {font-size: 5pt}" and "strong {font-size: 50%}".
The percentage in the "strong" rule is relative to the parent (h4).
</h4>
<p>
This "p" element has a font size of .50 in; thus the font size property
applies to the "p" element
The rule applied is "p {font-size: .50in}"
(NOTE: Should I list any more HTML elements on this page?)


All other properties on this page should be UA-default.
