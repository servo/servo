If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have a border
of UA-default.
The rule applied is "p {border: }".
So the border property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a border of solid red
<em>
This emphasized text should have a border of UA-default, since the 
border property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".

THe rule applied is 'h3 {border: solid red}".
So the border property applies to em and h3.

The rule applied is "h4 {border: solid green} ".
So the border property applies to h4.
</h4>

; so the border property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {border: solid blue}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a border of UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {border: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages do not apply.
</blockquote>
