<h1 >Testing Statement #1 Below of Section 5.6 of CSS1 Spec</h1>






<p>
1. The list-style properties describe how list items (i.e., elements with a
display value of "list-item") are formatted.  The list-style properties can be
set on any element, and it will inherit normally down the tree.




<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #1 above is passed, the list below should have
a list style image of an oval button.
The rule applied is "ol {
                         list-style-image: url(ovalbbut.gif);}".

<ol>
<li>
This li element should have a display value of list item and a list style
position of inside; this is because of the rule "li {display: list-item;
list-style-position: inside;}"
</ol>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
This inherited "ol ol li" element should have the same characteristics as
the item above, since these properties are inherited normally
</ol>
</ol>



<p>
This p element and the paragraph above should be UA-default.  The rule
stated is "p {list-style-type: square}" which should have no effect.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
