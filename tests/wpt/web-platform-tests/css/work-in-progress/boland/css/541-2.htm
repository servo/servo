PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>


If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should be normal.
The rule applied is "p {word-spacing: }".
So the word-spacing property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a 0.4em word spacing
<em>
This emphasized text should have a 0.4em word spacing, since the word spacing
property is inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {word-spacing: 0.4em}".
So the word spacing property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have an word spacing which is normal.
The rule applied is "word-spacing: normal".
So the word spacing property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a word spacing of 1.2em
; so the word spacing property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {word-spacing: 1.2em}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should be UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {word-spacing: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages are not applicable.
</blockquote>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
