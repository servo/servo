5. The color and style for the border is set with the "border" property.  The
margins are always transparent, so the parent element will shine through.

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #5 above is passed, the border of this paragraph should have
a blue border color and a dashed border style.  The rules applied are
"P {border-color: blue; border-style: dashed}".  The color of the margin
should also be blue, since the parent element will shine through.
All other properties should be UA-default.
