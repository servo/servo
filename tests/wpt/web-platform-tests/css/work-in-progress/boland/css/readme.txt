                        CASCADING STYLE SHEET LEVEL 1
                           (CSS1) SPECIFICATION


NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY DRAFT, AND MAY BE OBSOLETED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME


The tests below are given as examples.  I have covered the CSS1 specification
to identify all testable statements.  There are many more tests that are
formatted just like these, but I didn't want to overwhelm.  THere is one
sample test case included for each normative unit of the CSS1 specification.
I did not included the informative units, or units for which there were no
testable statements.

Each test has a style sheet, a list of testable statements, a semantic
specification, a test purpose, and a pass criterion.  The style sheet is
fairly generic, but can be customized to illustrate each test purpose.
All tests use style sheets.  The list of testable statements is given in
each test to determine if several statements should be tested together.
In other words, should functions be tested rather than individual statements
per se?  In the sample tests, the first testable statement of each unit is
tested; similar tests test the remaining testable statements.  The semantic
specification gives a somewhat subjective interpretation of the statement
being tested.  This may take the form of desired appearance, possibly compared
to a reference in the future, and interpretive specifications.  The test
purpose tries to lay out what is being tested - the function being tested.
I'm not sure if a "pass" criterion is needed, but I included a sample one for
completeness.  I'm of the view that a test is used to gather information.


Comments are appreciated.  This is a preliminary draft ( a strawman), being
made available for public review and comment.  Please send comments to:

The CSS1 Specification used as a reference for these test cases is the W3C

Thank you very much.
