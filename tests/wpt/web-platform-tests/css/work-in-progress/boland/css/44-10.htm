<h1>Testing Statement #10 Below of Section 4.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>






<ul>
<li>
10. This doesn't preclude the text on two adjacent liens from overlapping
each other.
The "line-height" may be smaller than the height of the text, in which case
the leading will be negative.
</ul>




<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #10 above is passed, then the text of each of the lines of
this paragraph should overlap.  This is because the text size is greater
than the line height.  The rules applied are "P {line-height: 10pt;
font-size: 15pt;}".
All other properties of this paragraph should be UA-default.
