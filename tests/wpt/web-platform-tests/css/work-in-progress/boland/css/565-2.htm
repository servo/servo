PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >

If statement #2 above is passed, then:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
This list style position should be outside (initial value).  
THe rule applied is "ul ul {list-style-position: }"
So the list style position applies to ul and li.
</ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
This list style position should be inside.
The rule applied to ol is "ol {list-style-position: inside}".
So the list style position property applies to ol.
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
This list style type should be outside.
The rule applied is to ul is "ul {list-style-position: outside}".
<ul>
<li>
This list item should also have list style position of outside, because
this property is inherited
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
This list item should have a list style position of UA-default.
The rule applied is "ul ul ul li {list-style-position: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages do not apply.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
