<p>
This text has three sections: (1) <em>emphasized(em)</em>text, (2)
regular text, and (3) <strong>strong(strong)</strong>text.  Even though
each of these has its own line height, the height of the line as a whole
should be the maximum of these three.
"em" and "strong" are inline elements.
Rules applied are "P {line-height: 14pt; font-size: 12pt}".
Also "em {line-height: 28pt;}" and "strong {line-height: 42pt;}
"
All other properties should be UA-default.
