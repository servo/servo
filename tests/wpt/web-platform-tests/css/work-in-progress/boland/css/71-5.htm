5. CSS style sheets are often embedded in HTML documents, and to be able to
hide style sheets from older UAs, it is convenient to put the style sheets
inside HTML comments.  The HTML comment tokens "<!--" and "-->" may occur
before, after, and in between the statements.  They may have whitespace
around them.
</ul>




<h2>PASS CRITERIA
</h2>
If statement #5 above is true, this paragraph should be UA-default.
The stylesheet given in the source here "P {font-style: italic; font-weight:
bold; color: blue;}" is enclosed in comments (with a lot of whitespace 
around them) and so is ignored.



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
Your browser should render this page similarly to this<a href="a715.gif">
reference image</a> or to this<a href="b715.gif">reference image</a>.
