If statement #6 above is passed, this paragraph should have a font variant 
of small caps (subject to character conversion issues), a background-
attachment of fixed, a word spacing of normal, a letter spacing of normal,
text transform of none, text align of left, border style of solid, and
height of auto.  This is regardless of the actual CSS rules applied here.
This is the core functionality.
For information, the rules applied are:
"p:first-line {font-style: small-caps}", "p {display: block}", "p {white-
spacing: normal}", "p {letter-spacing: normal}", "p {text-transform: none}",
'p {text-align: left}", "p {border-style: solid}", and "p {height: auto}".
