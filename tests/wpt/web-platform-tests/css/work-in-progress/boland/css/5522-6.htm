6. While the "border-width" property accepts up to four length values, this 
property only accepts one.
</ul>

</h2>
<p id=ID1>
If statement #6 above is passed, this paragraph should have a border of
thin solid blue.  The rule applied is "#id1 {border: thin solid blue}".
There is only one value for border-width.
<p ID=id2>
This paragraph should have a border of thick solid blue, despite the
fact that there are two values for border width in the stated rule.
The rule is "#id2 {border: thin thick solid blue}", but the first border
width value (thin) should be ignored since only one is allowed.



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
