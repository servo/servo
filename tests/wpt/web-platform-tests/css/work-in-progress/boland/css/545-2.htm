PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>

If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have no text
transform.
The rule applied is "p {text-transform: }".
So the text-transform property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a text transform of capitalize
<em>
This emphasized text should have a text transform of capitalize, since the 
text transform property is inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {text-transform: capitalize}".
So the text transform property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a text transform which is uppercase.
The rule applied is "text-transform: uppercase".
So the text transform property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a text transform of lowercase
; so the text transform property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {text-transform: 1.2em}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should be UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {text-transform: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages are not applicable.
</blockquote>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
