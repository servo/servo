9. All "@import" statements must occur at the start of a style sheet, before
any declarations.  Thus, rules in the style sheet itself override rules in
the imported style sheets.
</ul>








<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #9 above is true, this paragraph should be yellow.
This comes from rules in the imported style sheets (which come first in
the style declarations, as is proper) "P {color: red; font-family:
monospace;}".  This rule is overriden by the next imported rule "p {color:
yellow; font-family: helvetica}".
The non-imported rule comes next, as "p {font-size: 24pt}".
All other properties of this paragraph should be UA-default.
