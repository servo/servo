<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #1 above is true, this paragraph should have a flag pattern
background image which is not repeated.
The rule applied is "p {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)}".
Also "p {background-repeat: no-repeat;}".
<h3>
This h3 heading should have no background image (and a blank background).
Since there is no background image specified for h3, then the "repeat"
rule has no effect.
The only rule that is given for h3 is "h3 {background-repeat: repeat}".
</h3>

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
