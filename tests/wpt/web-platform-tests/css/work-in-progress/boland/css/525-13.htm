<ul>

13. If there are fewer than nine weights in the family, there is a default
algorithm for filling in the "holes".
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #13 above is passed, then:
<p ID=id1>
This paragraph should be lighter.
This is one weight in the family.
The rule applied is "#id1 {font-weight: lighter}"

<p ID=id2>
This paragraph should be bolder.
This is another weight in the family.
The rule applied is '#id2 {font-weight: bolder}"

<p ID=id3>
This paragraph should be bold.
This is yet another weight in the family.
The rule applied is "#id3 {font-weight: bold}"
<p ID=id4>
This paragraph should be normal.
This is still another weight in the family.
The rule applied is "#id4 {font-weight: normal}"





Since there are only four values of font weight above, other values may
be supplied by UA default.

All other properties should be UA-default.
