The headings and description for each subsection below describe the
functionality being tested.  The syntax of the test names below is
as follows(for xx-y): xx refers to the CSS1 unit identifier, and y
refers to the position of the testable statement within that 
identifier, where "1" is the first testable statement reading 
through the unit, "2" is the second, and so on.   Each of the tests
is designed so as to give assistance to the user.  The format of
each test is as follows: (1) at the top, a statement as to what is
being tested (no CSS1 rules here), (2) below this, the actual
testable statement from the spec (again, no CSS1 rules), (3) a heading
"pass criteria" to introduce the CSS1 material to be passed below, and
(4) below the heading, the CSS1 rendering for this particular UA.  (1)
through (3) above should look the same for every test (no CSS1); only
(4) should look different for each test, depending on the particular
CSS1 rendering.  The rendering is described entirely in terms of CSS1
properties, and at the bottom of each test it is possible to access
two different reference renderings for comparison.  Also, the CSS1
rules applied for that particular test are given as a part of the
rendering, so it should not be necessary to consult the source.
