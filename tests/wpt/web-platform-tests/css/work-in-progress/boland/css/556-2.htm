PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >

If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have a padding top
of 0.
The rule applied is "p {padding-top: }".
So the padding-top property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a padding top of 2em
<em>
This emphasized text should have a padding top of UA-default, since the 
padding top property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {padding-top: 2em}".
So the padding top property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a padding top which is 4em.
The rule applied is "padding-top: 4em".
So the padding top property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a padding top of 6em
; so the padding top property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {padding-top: 6em}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a padding top of 50% of that
of its parent (body element).
The rule applied is "blockquote {padding-top: 50%}", which should be
UA-default.
</blockquote>





All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
