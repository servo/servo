<h1>Testing Third Statement of Section 5.3.7 of CSS1 Spec</h1>





<ul>
<li >
3. The "background" property always sets all the individual background
properties (initial is "not defined for shorthand properties", applies to
all elements, not inherited, and percentage values are allowed on "background-
position")
</ul>

<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #3 above is passed, this paragraph should be UA-default
or initial values.
All of the individual background properties should be set to their
initial values.
The rule applied is "p {background: }".
So the background property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a gray background; all other specific
properties should be set to their initial values.
<em>
This emphasized text should be UA-default, since the background
property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {background: gray}".
So the background property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have an oval button image which is centered.
THe rule applied is "background: url(ovalbbut.gif) 50%50%".
All other specific properties should be initialized.
So the background property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a green background; all other specific
properties should be initialized.  So the background property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {background: green}".
(NOTE: Should other HTML elements be mentioned?)
</strong>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
