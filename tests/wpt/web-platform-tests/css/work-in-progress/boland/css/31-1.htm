<p>
If statement #1 above is passed, this paragraph should be 12pt italic.
The rule applied is "P {font-size: 12pt ! important; font-style: italic;}".
Since the font-size of the rule above is important, it will resist attempts
to change it in the presentation.
All other properties of this paragraph should be UA-default.

<h3>
This h3 heading should be red with a lime background; the rule applied is
"h3 {color: red ! important; background: lime ! important}" (the "important"
delineation means that these rules resist change in the presentation)
