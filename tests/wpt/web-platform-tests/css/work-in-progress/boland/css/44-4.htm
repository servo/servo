<h1>Testing Statement #4 Below of Section 4.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>






<ul>
<li>
4. If a line of text contains sections with different "line-height" values 
(because there are inline elements on the line), each of those sections has its
own half-leading above and below.
</ul>



<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #4 above is passed, then:
<p>
The section <em>happy holidays(em)</em>, which is emphasized, has a different
line height than the rest of the text.  This is because there is an inline
element (em) present.  The rule applied is "P {line-height: 14pt; font-
size: 12pt}".
Also "em {line-height: 28pt}".
All other properties should be UA-default.
