2. The position of the image, if/how it is repeated, and whether it is fixed or
scrolled relative to the canvas can also be set.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #2 above is true:
<p>
This paragraph should have flag image starting in upper left corner, scrolling
along with element, and repeating both horizontally and vertically.
The rules applied are: P {background-image: url(flagbg.gif);
                          background-attachment: scroll;
                          background-repeat: repeat;
                          background-position: 0%0%;}
Thus one can set a number of specific background properties on this
"p" element.

<h3>
This h3 heading should have a flag image ending in lower right corner of
element, fixed, and not repeating.
The rules applied are: h3 {background-position: 100%100%;
                           background-attachment: fixed;
                           background-repeat: no-repeat;
                           background-image: url(flagbg.gif);
                          }
Thus one can set a number of detailed background properties on this
"h3" element.
