<h1 >Testing Statement #2 Below of Section 5.2.5 of CSS1 Spec</h1>

<ul>
<li>
2. For "font-weight", initial is "normal", it applies to all elements, it is 
inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<blockquote>
If statement #2 above is passed, then
this blockquote has a UA-default (or normal) font weight; the
initial value is normal.  No explicit CSS1 rules are applied.
</blockquote>
<p>
This paragraph has font weight of 800 (dark).
The rule applied is "p {font-weight: 800}".
So the font weight property applies to the "p" element.

<h3>
This h3 heading, including this emphasized <em>word</em>, has
a font weight of 200 (light).
The rule applied is "h3 {font-weight: 200}", and since "em" is
a descendant of "h3", "em" inherits this font weight value.
So the font weight property applies to the "h3" element.
</h3>

<h4>
This "h4" heading should be UA-default.  There is a nonsensical
rule applied, "h4 {font-weight: 200%}", which should be ignored,
having no effect.
</h4>
<h5>
This h5 heading should have a font weight of bold.  
The rule applied is "h5 {font-weight: bold}".
The word <strong>strong</strong>, however, should have a font
weight of 100 (light).  This rule is "strong {font-weight: 100}".
So the font weight property applies to the "strong" element.
</h5>





<em>
Text below is emphasized.
All other properties should be UA-default.
