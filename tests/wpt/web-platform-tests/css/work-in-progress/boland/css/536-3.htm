<h1>Testing Statement #3 Below of Section 5.3.6 of CSS1 Spec</h1>





<ul>
<li >
3. For "background-position", initial is "0%0%", it applies to block-level and
replaced elements, it is not inherited, and percentage values refer to the size
of the element itself.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #3 above is passed, then:
<blockquote>
This blockquote should be UA-default. The rule applied is
"blockquote {background-position: }", which should be the initial
value of 0%0%.
</blockquote>
<p>
This paragraph should have a flag pattern at the top of the eleent.
The rule applied is "p {background-position: top}".
Thus the background-position property applies to block-level elements.
<em>
This emphasized text should have no background image and thus
not background position since the background position property is not
inherited, and 'em" is a child of "p".
</em>
The image below should have a flag pattern background in the center.
The rule applied is "img {background-position: center}".
Thus the background-position property applies to replaced elements.
<img src="ovalbbut.gif">

<h3>
This h3 element should have a flag pattern which is 50% of the size of
the element.
The rule applied is "h3 {background-position: 50%}".
</h3>
Note that the rule "blockquote,p,img,h3 {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)"
also applies here.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
