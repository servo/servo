PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #7 above is passed, this paragraph should be yellow.
The rule applied (from the first imported style sheet) is "P {color: red;
font-family: monospace;}".  This rule overrides the rule (from the second
imported style sheet) "P {color: yellow; font-family: helvetica}".  The
final rule "p {color: yellow}" overrides both of these.  The
other properties should be UA-default.
The two imported style sheets cascade with each other.
