<p>


Tests evaluate the ability of browsers to render CSS1 information according
to accepted behavior.
The tests are given as examples.  The CSS1 specification is covered
to identify all testable statements.  There is one test case
included for each testable statement of the CSS1 specification.
Not included are informative units, or units for which there were no
testable statements.  It is attempted to use the same style sheets within each
section, to limit what is being tested.  The purpose of these tests is to
compare CSS1 implementations against the CSS1 Recommendation, or to demonstrate
interoperability of CSS1 implementations from different vendors.

<p>
Each test has one or more style sheets, a testable statement, 
a heading describing the test, and a pass criterion 
The "pass criterion" portion covers the style sheet implementation; the rest of
the page is just HTML.
This is again to limit what is being tested for each test and to control the
test environment.
The tests assume that 
(where appropriate) no personal stylesheets are being used, and User Agent
default information cannot be tested here; in addition, other factors may affect
whether or not the tests are passed.
Various assumptions are made, including support for appropriate CSS1 
properties.
The tests should be able to
stand alone, or be used in combination.
Also, it is possible to test more than one testable statement in a single test
case, although this has not been done here.
One should know by looking directly at the browser's rendition and the comparison
snapshots whether a test has been passed, although it is possible to look at the
source code also.

Where reader rules are to be tested, the reader may need to
"manually" insert reader rules into the test as appropriate and directed.
User preference settings may have some effect on the outcome of color
rendering.  Closing paragraphs and list items (with the optional tags
"/P" and "/LI" may have some effect on the outcome of their and
subsequent elements' rendering.
A few of the tests are not yet complete.
<p>
You have the ability to enter your test information, view previous test results,comment on particular tests, or propose new tests.  Results 
of the tests are available to any visitor to the site.
In the future, a facility may be added where you can dynamically test
your customized CSS code interactively.


<p>
Running your browser through the test suite is a way for you to contribute to
the collective knowledge of the Web development community.  When you participate,
you will be offered a series of tests, each of which depicts a particular CSS1
fragment.  You will be asked to indicate whether your browser seems to render
the CSS1 according to acceptable behavior.
<p>
Help information is included below, in the sense that if one wants to test a
particular function, there is a mapping of that function to tests for it below.
In addition, there is a reference parser covering CSS1.
It is not intended to duplicate that capability here, 
but to complement it.

Comments are appreciated.  This is a preliminary draft ( a strawman), being
made available for public review and comment.  Please send comments to:

The CSS1 Specification used as a reference for these test cases is the W3C
Recommendation REC-CSS1-961217, dated 17 December 1996.
