9. A ruleset consists of a selector-string followed by a declaration-block.
The selector string consists of everything up to (but not including) the first
left curly brace.  A ruleset that starts with a selector-string that is not
valid CSS1 is skipped.
</ul>




<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #9 above is passed,  this
<em>emphasized text</em> should be bold.  The h3 heading below should be
blue.  The rules stated here are " h3 {color: blue}", "p[align], ul {color:
red; font-size: large}", and "p em {font-weight: bold}".
The second rule is illegal, so should be ignored.
<h3>
This h3 heading should be blue, in accordance with the above.
</h3>



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
