2. "white-space" has initial normal, it applies to block-level elements, 
it is inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>




<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >

If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have a white space
of normal.
The rule applied is "p {white-space: }".
So the white-space property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a white space of normal
<em>
This emphasized text should have a white space of UA-default, since the 
white space property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {white-space: normal}".
So the white space property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a white space which is pre.
The rule applied is "h4 {white-space: pre}".
So the white space property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a white space of nowrap
; so the white space property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {white-space: nowrap}".
(NOTE: Should other HTML elements be mentioned?)
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a white space of UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {white-space: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages do not apply.
</blockquote>





All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
