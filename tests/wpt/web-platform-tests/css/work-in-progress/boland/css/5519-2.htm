PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >

If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have a right border
of UA-default.
The rule applied is "p {border-right: }".
So the border-right property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a right border of red solid
<em>
This emphasized text should have a right border of UA-default, since the 
border right property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {border-right: red solid}".
So the border right property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a right border which is blue solid.
The rule applied is " h4 {border-right: blue solid}".
So the border right property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a border right of yellow solid
; so the border right property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {border-right: yellow solid}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a margin top of UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {border-right: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages do not apply.
</blockquote>





All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
