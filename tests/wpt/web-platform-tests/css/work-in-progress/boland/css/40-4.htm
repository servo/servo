PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>

<p>
If statement #4 above is passed, the background for this paragraph (including
the surrounding padding area of 1.25 cm relative to the edges of the canvas)
should be red.  The rules applied are: "P {padding: 1.25cm; background-
color: red}".  Even though background color is set on the "P" element, the
color is extended to include the surrounding padding.  Margin, border, and
other properties of this paragraph should be UA-default.
