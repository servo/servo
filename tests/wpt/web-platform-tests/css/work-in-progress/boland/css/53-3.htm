<h1 >Testing Statement #3 Below for Section 5.3 of CSS1 Spec</h1>


<ul>
<li>
3. The color property inherits normally.  The background properties do not 
inherit, but the parent elemtn's background will shine through by default
because of the initial transparent value on background-color.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #3 above is true:
<p>
This paragraph should be silver.  The <em>emphasized text</em> here should
also be silver, because the color property inherits normally, and "em" is
a descendant of "p".
The rule applied is "p {color: silver}".
The body background of this page should be yellow, because of the rule
"body {background: yellow}".  The "p" element does not inherit this.

<h3>
This h3 element does not inherit the yellow color, but the yellow should
shine through by default.
</h3>

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
