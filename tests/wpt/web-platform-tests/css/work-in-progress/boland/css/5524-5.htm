5. If the width and height of a replaced element are both auto, these properties
will be set to the intrinsic dimensions of the element.
If applied to a textual element, the height can be enforced with e.g., a 
scrollbar.  Negative values are not allowed.
</ul>




<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #5 above is passed, this paragraph should have a height of 400px
which would be enforced by scrolling if necessary.
The rule applied is "p {height: 400px}".
The image below should have intrinsic height and width of 150px and 250px,
respectively, since the rule applied is "img.oval {height: auto;
                                                   width: auto;}".
<img class=oval src="ovalbbut.gif">



<p ID=id1>
This paragraph should have UA-default height.  The rule stated is
"#id1 {height: -100px}", which should be ignored since the value is negative.
<p>
All other properties should be UA-default.
