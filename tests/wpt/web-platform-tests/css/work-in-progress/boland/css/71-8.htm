<ul>
<li>
8. A block starts with a left curly brace and ends with the matching right
curly brace.  In between there may be any characters, except that parentheses,
brackets, and braces always occur in matching pairs and may be nested.  Single
and double quotes also occur in matching pairs, and characters between them
are parsed as a string.
</ul>




<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #8 above is passed, this paragraph should be UA-default.
In the example block, included in the source, the right brace between the
quotes does not match the opening brace of the block, and the second
single quote is an escaped character, and thus doesn't match the opening
quote.



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
