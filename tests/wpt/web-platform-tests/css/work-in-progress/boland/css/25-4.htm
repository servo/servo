<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #4 above is passed, then:
<p>
The first line and first letter of this paragraph should be UA-default.  This is
because the application of "P:first-line:first-letter {color:blue}" involves
two pseudo-elements per selector, which is not allowed.  All other properties
of this paragraph should also be UA-default.

<h2>
<h2:first-line>
The first line of this h2 heading should be red; 
</h2:first-line>
the remaining lines should be UA-default (the rule applied is 
"h2:first-line {color: red}", which has one pseudo-element per selector)
</h2>
<h3>
<h3:first-letter>
T
</h3:first-letter>
he first letter of this h3 heading should be green; the remaining letters
should be UA-default (the rule applied is "h3:first-letter {color: green}"
which has one pseudo-element per selector)
