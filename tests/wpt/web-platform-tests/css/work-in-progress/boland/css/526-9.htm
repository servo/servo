<h2>
PASS CRITERIA
</h2>
<p>
If statement #9 above is passed, then:

<p>
This paragraph should have a font-size of 12pt.
The rule applied is "p {font-size: 12pt}".
This <em>emphasized text</em> within this paragraph should have a font size
of 150%, because "em" is a child of "p".
The rule applied here is "em {font-size: 150%}".
This <strong>strong text</strong> within this paragraph should have a font
size of 18pt (150% of parent's), because of the value of 1.5em.
The rule applied here is "strong {font-size: 1.5em}", which is relative
to the parent's font size.
The font size of the emphasized and the strong text should be the same.

The font weight of the "strong" element should be 1.5ex relative to the
default font weight of the "strong" element, because of the rule
"strong {font-weight: 1.5ex}"; thus, for othe properties, "ex" and "em"
apply to the element itself.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
