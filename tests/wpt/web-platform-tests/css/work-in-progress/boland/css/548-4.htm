4. When a numerical value is specified, the line height is given by the font size
of the current element multiplied with the numerical value.  When a numerical
value is specified, child elements will inherit the factor itself, not the
resultant value (as is the case with percentage and other units).




<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #4 above is passed, this paragraph should have a line height 
of 15pt (10pt font size times 1.5).
The rule applied is "p {font-size: 10pt;
                        line-height: 1.5}".
This <em>emphasized text</em> shoudl have a line height of 6pt (font-size
of 4pt times inherited factor of 1.5); "em" is a child of p.
The rule applied is "em {font-size: 4pt}".
<h3>
This h3 heading should have a line height of 15pt (10pt font-size times
150%).
The rule applied is "h3 {font-size: 10pt;
                         line-height: 150%}".
This <strong>strong text</strong> should also ahve a line height of 15pt,
because it inherits the value from its parent (h3).
