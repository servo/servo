<h1 >Testing Statement #15 Below of Section 5.2.5 of CSS1 Spec</h1>

<ul>
<li>
15. Precise meaning; "lighter" selects the next lighter keyword with a different
font from the inherited one, unless there is no such font, in which case, it
selects the next liehgter numerical value (and keeps the font unchanged).
</ul>



<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #15 above is passed, then:
<p ID=id2>
This paragraph should have a font weight of bold.  This strong<strong>
word</strong> also has a font weight of bold, since "strong" inherits
from the "p" element.
The rule applied here is "#id2 {font-weight: bold}".
This <em ID=id3>emphasized text</em> has a lighter font weight.
This is relative to the "bold" designation for "p".
The rule applied to "em" is "#id3 {font-weight: lighter}".

<p ID=id7>
This paragraph has a font weight of 300 (light).
The rule applied is "#id7 {font-weight: 300}".
This <em ID=id3>emphasized text</em> has a lighter font weight,
relative to the "300" (light) designation for "p".
The rule applied to "em" is the same as in the above paragraph.





All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
