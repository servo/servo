10. The UA may choose to honor other stylistic HTML attributes.  If so, these
attributes are translated to the corresponding CSS rules with specificity equal
to 1.

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p style="color: green">
If statement #10 above is passed , this paragraph should be green.
The rules applied are "P {color: red}" and "P STYLE: "color="green".
The rule in the color attribute should override the one in the CSS1 
color rule, even though both have the same specificity.

<p>
This paragraph should be red, because there is no inline style set.
