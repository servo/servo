<h1 >Testing Statement #2 Below of Section 5.2.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>






<ul>
<li>
2. For "font-variant", initial is "normal", it applies to all elements, it is
inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>

<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<blockquote>
If statement #2 above is passed, then
this blockquote should be UA-default font variant.  
The only explicit CSS1 rule is "blockquote {font-variant: 200%}", which
should be ignored, so the initial value should be UA-specific, and the
percentage value in the rule does not apply.
</blockquote>


<p>
This paragraph should have small caps font variant.  
The rule applied is "p {font-variant: small-caps}".
So the font variant property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This paragraph should have normal font variant.
The rule applied is "h3 {font-variant: normal}".
So the font variant property applies to the "h3" element.
</h3>
<h4>
This h4 heading should have normal font variant, but this emphasized
<em>word(em)</em> should have small caps font variant.
The rules applied are "h4 {font-variant: normal}" and
"em {font-variant: small-caps}".
So the font variant property applies to the "em" element.
</h4>
<h4>
This h4 heading should have normal font variant, and this strong
<strong>word</strong> should also have normal font variant, since
"strong" is a descendant of "h4".  Thus the font variant property
applies to the "strong" element.
The rule applied is "h4 {font-variant: normal}".
</h4>
<strong>
The text below is strong.
All other properties should be UA-default.
