<h1 >Testing Statement #8 Below of Section 5.2.2 of CSS1 Spec</h1>


<ul>
<li>
8. For "font-family", if quoting is omitted, any whitespace characters before
and after the font name are ignored, and any sequence of whitespace characters
inside the font name is converted to a single space.
</ul>

<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #8 above is passed, then:
<p ID=id1>
This paragraph should be new century schoolbook font family first, and
serif second, if first choice is not available.
If serif not available, UA-default should be used.
The rule applied is "#id1 {font-family:   new  century  schoolbook  , serif}"
There are no quotes around   new  century  schoolbook  , so the whitespace
around this name will be condensed to read - new century schoolbook.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
