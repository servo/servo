<h1>Testing Statement #3 Below of Section 5.3.5 of CSS1 Spec</h1>





<ul>
<li >
3. For "background-attachment", initial is "scroll", it applies to all elements,
it is not inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<blockquote>
If statement #3 above is passed, this blockquote should be
UA-default.  The rule applied is "blockquote: background-attachment:
}".
However, there is a flag pattern.
</blockquote>
<p>
This paragraph should have a flag pattern which is fixed with respect
to the canvas.  The rule applied is "p {background-attachment: fixed}".
<em>This emphasized text within the paragraph should have no flag
pattern (neither fixed nor scroll), because the background-attachment
property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of "p".
</em>
<h3>
This h3 element should have a flag pattern which scrolls.
The rule applied is "h3 {background-attachment: scroll}".
</h3>
<strong>
This strong text should have a background-attachment of scroll, but
there is no reference image.
The only rule applied is "srong {background-attachment: scroll}".
</strong>
<h4>
This h4 element should be UA-default.  The nonsensical rule applied
here is"h4 {background-attachment: 200%}", which should be ignored
by the UA.
However, there is a flag pattern.
</h4>

Note that the rule "blockquote,p,h3,h4 {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)}"
also applies to the above.  The background-attachment property applies
to the blockquote, p, h3, h4, em, and strong elements, to name a few.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
