<h2>Testing Statement #4 Below of Section 6.2 of CSS1 Spec</h2>



<ul>
<li>
4. In all inherited CSS1 properties, if the value is specified as a
percentage, child elements inherit the resultant value, not the percentage
value.
</ul>


<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #4 above is passed, this paragraph should have a font size of
20px and a line height of 
30px; the rule applied is "p {font-size: 20px; line-height: 150%;}"..
<em>This emphasized text should also have a line height of 30px, because
em is a child of p, and inherits the line height value of p;
this is even though the rule "em {font-size: 12px}" is applied, so em
should have a font size of 12px.
</em>
</p>

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
