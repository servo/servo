<h1>Testing Statement #3 Below of Section 5.3.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>





<ul>
<li >
3. For "background-repeat", initial is "repeat", it applies to all elements,
it is not inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #3 above is passed, then:
<blockquote>
This blockquote should have a flag pattern with a repeating pattern.
The rules applied are: "blockquote {background-image: url(flagbg.gif);
                                    background-repeat: }".
Since there is no value specified for background-repeat, the initial
value (repeat) is used.
Also, the background-repeat property applies to the blockquote element.
</blockquote>
<p>
This paragraph has an image that is repeated in the horizontal 
direction.
The rule applied is "p {background-repeat: repeat-x}".
Also, "p {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)}"
So the background-repeat property applies to the "p" element.
<em> This emphasized text within this paragraph has no repeating
background image, because the "background-repeat" property does not
inherit, and "em" is a descendant of "p".
However, the background-repeat property does apply to the 
"em" element.
</em>
<h3>
This h3 heading has an oval button image which should be repeated
according to the UA-default property.  The nonsensical rule applied
is "h3 {background-repeat: 200%}", and since percentages do not
apply, this rule shuld be ignored.  However, the background-repeat
property does apply to the h3 element.
Also, "h3 {background-image: url(ovalbbut.gif)}".
</h3>
<h4>
This h4 element has a flag pattern image which is not repeated.
The rules applied are "h4 {background-image: url(flagbg.gif);
                           background-repeat: no-repeat}".
Here is some more text to test this more effectively here.
Here is some more text to test this more effectively here.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text has
an oval button image which is repeated in the x-direction.  The
rules applied here are "strong {background-image: url(ovalbbut.gif);
                                background-repeat: repeat-x}".
Note that the background-repeat property does apply to the h4 and
strong elements.
</strong>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
