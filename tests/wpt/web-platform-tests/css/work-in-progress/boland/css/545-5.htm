5. The actual transformation in each case is human language dependent.

<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #5 above is passed, this paragraph should have the first 
character of each word uppercase, because this is in English, and that is
how the English language works.
The rule applied is "p {text-transform: capitalize}".
Other languages may work differently.


All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
