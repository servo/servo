<h1>Testing Statement #8 Below of Section 4.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>






<ul>
<li>
8. Replaced elements (e.g., images) on the line can make the line-box bigger,
if the top of the replaced element is above the tallest text section, or if
the bottom is below the lowest.
</ul>



<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #8 above is passed, then:
<p>
This first line of text should have line height that is UA-default.  On the
next line of text there is an <img src="ovalbbut.gif">oval button image 
which is larger than the text, so it will make the line height it's on
the size (width) that it is.
No explicit style sheet rules are applied here.
All other properties should be UA-default.
