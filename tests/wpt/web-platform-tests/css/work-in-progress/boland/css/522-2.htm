<h1 >Testing Statement #2 Below of Section 5.2.2 of CSS1 Spec</h1>


<ul>
<li>
2. For "font-family", initial is "UA-specific", it applies to all elements, 
it is inherited, and percentage values are N/A.
</ul>
<h2>PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #2 above is passed, then:
<p> This "p" element should have font family of serif.  The rule applied is
"p {font-family: serif}", so font-family applies to the "p" element.
<h3> This "h3" element should have font family of sans-serif.  The rule
applied is "h3 {font-family: sans-serif}", so font-family applies to the
"h3" element.
</h3>
<p>
The word <em>important(em)</em> within this paragraph should have monospace
font family.  The rule applied is "em {font-family: monospace}".  So font
family applies to this em element.  The rest of the paragraph should be
serif, per the paragraph above.
<h3>
The word<strong> great</strong> is "strong" in this h3 heading, and so
should be sans-serif, along with the rest of the heading, since "strong"
is a descendant of "h3", and the font-family property is inherited.  So
the rule for "h3", "h3 {font-family: sans-serif}", applies to all
descendants.
</h3>


<h4>
This h4 heading should be UA-default.  
The nonsensical rule "h4 {font-family: 200%}" should not have any effect,
since percentages do not apply to font family.
</h4>
NOTE: If specified fonts above are not available, UA-defaults will be used.
The font-family property for the remainder of this page should be UA-default,
since initial value is UA-specific.  Also, all other properties should be
UA-default.
