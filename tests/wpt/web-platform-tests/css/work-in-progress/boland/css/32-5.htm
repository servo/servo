<h1 >Testing Statement #5 Below of Section 3.2 of CSS1 Spec</h1>



<p>
5. Sort by specificity of selector: more specific selectors will override more
general ones.  To find the specificity, count the number of ID attributes in the
selector (a), the number of CLASS attributes in the selector (b), and the
number of tag names in the selector (c).  Concatenating the three numbers gives
the specificity.
