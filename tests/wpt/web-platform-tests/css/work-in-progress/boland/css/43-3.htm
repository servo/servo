<p>
<img src = "ovalbbut.gif">
The image tag here is replaced by its contents.  Here "img" is in a block-level
element.
<p>
In this case, the image <img src="ovalbbut.gif">, which is an inline element,
is replaced by its contents.


The width of the img element should be "auto" by default, even though no
style sheet rule is explicitly specified.
All properties of this page should be UA-default.
