2. Properties set on "first-line" will be inherited by "first-letter" but are
overridden if the same property is set on "first-letter."
</ul>

<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>

If statement #2 above is passed, then:
<p>
<p:first-line>
<p:first-letter>
T
</p:first-letter>he first letter of this paragraph has a font size of 36pt.
</p:first-line>
The rest of the first line has a font size of 24pt.  All of the characters
on the first line are green.  The rest of the paragraph is red and 12pt font
size.  The rules applied are "P {color: red; font-size: 12pt",
"P:first-letter {font-size: 300%}", and "P:first-line {color: green;
font-size: 200%}".  The first-letter element is inside the first-line
element; the first letter color will inherit from the first line color
(since it is not set separately) but the first letter font size will be
different since it is set explicity in first letter.
All other properties of this paragraph are UA-default.
