<h1 >Testing Statement #2 Below of Section 5.2.7 of CSS1 Spec</h1>





<ul>
<li>
2. For "font", initial is "not defined for shorthand properties",
it applies to all elements, it is
inherited, and percentage values are allowed on font-size and line-height.
</ul>

<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #2 above is passed, then:
<blockquote>
The font for this blockquote element is UA-default, or "not defined for
shorthand elements".  No explicit CSS1 rules are applied here.
</blockquote>

<p>
This paragraph should have a font of 12pt sans-serif.
The rule applied is "p {font: 12pt sans-serif}".
So the font property applies to the "p" element, and to the "blockquote"
element above.  
<em>Emphasized text</em> within this paragraph should have a font of 6pt
sans-serif.  So the font property applies to the "em" element.
The rule applied here is "em {font: 50% sans-serif}", where the 50%
applies to the font size of the parent element; therefore the percentage
value is allowed on "font-size".
<strong>Strong text</strong> here has the same font as the parent element,
because "strong" is a child of "p", and so the font property is inherited.



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
NOTE: If specified font is not available, UA-default will be used.
