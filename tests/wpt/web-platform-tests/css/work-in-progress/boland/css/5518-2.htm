PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >

If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have a border-top
of UA-default.
The rule applied is "p {border-top: }".
So the border-top property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a border top of thin solid
<em>
This emphasized text should have a border top of UA-default, since the 
border top property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {border-top: thin solid}".
So the border top property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a border top which is medium solid.
The rule applied is "border-top: medium solid".
So the border top property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a border top of thick solid
; so the border top property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {border-top: thick solid}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a margin top of UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {border-top: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages do not apply.
</blockquote>
