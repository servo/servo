<h1>Testing Statement #11 Below of Section 5.4.4 of CSS1 Spec</h1>








<ul>
<li>
11. Negative values are possible.  This allows precise control over the vertical
position of elements (such as images that are used in place of letters) that
don't have a baseline.
</ul>



<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #11 above is passed, this paragraph should have an inline
image (oval button), which is lowered to the baseline of the next lower
line, as follows:
<img src="ovalbbut.gif">
The rule applied here is "img {vertical-align: -100%}".
Note that this is a negative value.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
