4. IF the inline element has attached margins, borders, padding, or text
decorations, these will have no effect where the element is broken.
</ul>


<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #4 above is passed, then there are some words that follow that may be important.
The words <em id="id1">now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
country</em> are emphasized and have a dashed border surrounding them, but
since the line is long the inline element "em" is broken into two boxes,
along with the dashed line.
The rule applied is "em {border-style: dashed}".
All other properties should be UA-default.
</p>

<p>
There are some more words below that may be important in the context of
the information below.
The words <em>now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
country</em> are emphasized, but have no dashed border surrounding them
like above.  However, the inline element "em" should be broken here exactly
the same as in the above paragraph (e.g., borders, margins, padding, or
text decorations should have no effect).
