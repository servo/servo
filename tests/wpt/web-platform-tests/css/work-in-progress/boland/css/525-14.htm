<h1 >Testing Statement #14 Below of Section 5.2.5 of CSS1 Spec</h1>

<ul>
<li>
14. Precise meaning: "bolder" selects the next weight that is assigned to a font
that is darker than the inherited one.  If there is no such weight, it simply
results in the next darker numerical value (and the font remains unchanged).
</ul>



<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement #14 above is passed, then:
<p ID=id1>
This paragraph has a font weight of bold.
The rule applied is "#id1 {font-weight: bold}".
This <em ID=id4>emphasized text</em> is bolder than the rest of the
paragraph, because of the rule 
"#id4 {font-weight: bolder}".
"em" is descendant of "p".
This <strong>strong</strong> word should be the same font weight as the
rest of the paragraph, because "strong" value is inherited from parent "p".
<p ID=id5>
This paragraph has a font weight of 100 (light).
The rule applied is "#id5 {font-weight: 100}".
This <em ID=id4>emphasized text</em> is bolder than the rest of the
paragraph, but lighter than the emphasized text in the paragraph above,
because "em" 's value is relative to parent's value.
Rule for "em" applied is "#id4 {font-weight: bolder}".
UAs may differ in their interpretations here.






All other properties should be UA-default.
