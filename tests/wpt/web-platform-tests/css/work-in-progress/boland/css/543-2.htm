PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>


If statement #2 above is passed, this paragraph should have no text
decoration.
The rule applied is "p {text-decoration: }".
So the text-decoration property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a text decoration of underline
<em>
This emphasized text should have a text decoration of underline,  
even though the
text decoration property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {text-decoration: underline}".
So the text decoration property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a text decoration which is overline.
The rule applied is "text-decoration: overline".
So the text decoration property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a text decoration of line-through
; so the text decoration property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {text-decoration: line-through}".
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should be UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {text-decoration: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages are not applicable.
</blockquote>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
