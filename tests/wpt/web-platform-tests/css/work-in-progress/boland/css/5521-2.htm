of UA-default.

So the border-left property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>

border left property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".

The rule applied is "border-left: solid".
So the border left property applies to h4.
</h4>

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a margin top of UA-default.
The rule applied is "blockquote {border-left: 200%}", which should be
ignored since percentages do not apply.
