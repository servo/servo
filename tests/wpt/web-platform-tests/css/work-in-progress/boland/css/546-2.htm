PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #2 above is passed, the body of this page should
be UA-specific.  The rule applied is "body {text-align:}".
So the text-align property applies to the body element.
<p>
This paragraph should have a right text align.  
The rule appleid is "p {text-align: right}".
So the text-align property applies to the p element.
<h3>
This h3 heading should have a left text align.
The rule applied is "h3 {text-align: left}".
So the text-align property applies to the h3 element.
</h3>
<h4>
This h4 element should have a UA-specific text-align, since h4 is a child
of body element, and this property is inherited.
</h4>
<blockquote>
THis blockquote element should have a UA-default text align.
The rule stated is "blockquote {text-align: 200%}", which should be ignored
since percentages do not apply.
</blockquote>



All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
