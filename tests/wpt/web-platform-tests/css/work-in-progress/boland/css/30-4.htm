PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
If statement #4 above is passed, then:
<p>
This paragraph should be red monospace, because the author's rule given
above "P {color: red; font-family: monospace;}", may have greater weight
than the reader's rule.  Both of
these have a greater weight than the UA-default.  This is because there
may be multiple rules (one author, one reader, one UA-default) for color for
the "P" element.
