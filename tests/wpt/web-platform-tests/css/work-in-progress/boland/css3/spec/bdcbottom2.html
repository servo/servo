All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have blue border bottom color.  Border bottom style of solid is applied to all CSS rules,
so that bottom border is visible.  The body's bottom border color of yellow should display,
since the rule "body {border-bottom-color: yellow}" applies.
