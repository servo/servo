<ul>
<li >
For "border-style", initial is "see individual properties", it applies to all elements,
it is not inherited, percentage values are N/A, media is visual, and for computed value
see individual properties.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
NOTE: Not all of border-style values may be implemented yet?
<p>
If statement above is correct, this paragraph should have 
border style of UA-default (no border?).  No specific CSS rules are applied.  However, the
border style property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border style of dotted, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border style of dashed; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-style: dotted;}"
"em {border-style: dashed;}"
So the border style property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border style property of solid (because of the
rule "h4 {border-style: solid;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border style of UA-default, because the border-style
property does not inherit. 
So the border style property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border style (no border?).  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-style: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-style property does apply to the blockquote element.
