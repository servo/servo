<em>This emphasized text within the paragraph should have no flag
pattern (neither fixed nor scroll), because the background-attachment
property is not inherited, and "em" is a child of "p".
However, the parent's flag pattern may shine through by default.

This strong text has assigned a background-attachment of scroll, but
there is no background image, so the rule should be ignored.

<h4>
This h4 element should be UA-default.  The nonsensical rule applied
here is"h4 {background-attachment: 200%}", which should be ignored
by the UA.
The UA-default is probably scroll of a NIST image.
Also "h4 {background-image: url(nist.gif);}".

</h4>
<p>
Thus the background-attachment property applies 
to the blockquote, p, h3, h4, em, and strong elements, to name a few.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph like the one above, but may not be long enough to
support a background image and attachment.
