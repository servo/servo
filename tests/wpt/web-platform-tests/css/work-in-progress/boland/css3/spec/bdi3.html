<h3>
This h3 heading has a border-image of tile(flagbg.gif, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%) repeat-x, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border-image of tile(nist.gif, 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%) stretch no-repeat; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-image: tile(flagbg.gif, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%) repeat-x;}"
"em {border-image: tile(nist.gif), 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%) stretch no-repeat;}"
So the border-image property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border-image of tile(ovalbbut.gif, 15%, 15%, 15%, 15%) repeat-y (because of the
rule "h4 {border-image: tile(ovalbbut.gif, 15%, 15%, 15%, 15%) repeat-y;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border-image of (none), because the border-image
property does not inherit.  
So the border-image property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border-image.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-image: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-image property does apply to the blockquote element.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above. Border-style of solid is applied to all rules,
so that if the image specified is unavailable a solid border will appear.
