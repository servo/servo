All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have solid border top style.  The body's border top style of groove should display,
since the rule "body {border-top-style: groove}" applies. 
Also "body {border-top-width: 30px;}" is applied to indicate this more effectively.
