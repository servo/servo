All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have thin border left width.  The body's border right width of 20px should display,
since the rule "body {border-right-width: 20px;}" applies.  Border right style of solid
is applied to all CSS rules, so that right border is visible.
