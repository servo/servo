<h3>
This h3 heading has a border bottom style of dashed, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border bottom style of solid; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-bottom-style: dashed;}"
"em {border-bottom-style: solid;}"
So the border bottom style property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border bottom style property of dotted (because of the
rule "h4 {border-bottom-style: dotted;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border bottom style of "none", because the border-bottom-style
property does not inherit. 
However, the border bottom style property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border bottom style (no bottom border?).  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-bottom-style: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-bottom-style property does apply to the blockquote element.
