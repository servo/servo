<h3>
This h3 heading has a border top style of dashed, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border top style of solid; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-top-style: dashed;}"
"em {border-top-style: solid;}"
So the border top style property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border top style property of dotted (because of the
rule "h4 {border-top-style: dotted;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border top style of "none", because the border-top-style
property does not inherit. 
However, the border top style property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border top style (no top border?).  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-top-style: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-top-style property does apply to the blockquote element.
