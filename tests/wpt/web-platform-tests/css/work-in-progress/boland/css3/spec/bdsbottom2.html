All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have solid border bottom style.  The body's border bottom style of groove should display,
since the rule "body {border-bottom-style: groove}" applies.  Also "body {border-bottom-width: 30px;}"
is applied to indicate this more effectively.
