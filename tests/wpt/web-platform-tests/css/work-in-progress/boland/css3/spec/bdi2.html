<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should have the same
border-image set. The body's border-image of tile(nist.gif, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%) repeat stretch  
should display,
since the rule "body {border-image: tile(nist.gif, 10%, 10%, 10%, 10%) repeat stretch;}" applies. 
Border-style of solid is applied to all rules, so that if the specified image is unavailable a
solid border will appear.
