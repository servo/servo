All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have 10px border top width.  Border top style of solid is applied to all CSS rules,
so that top border is visible.  The body's top border width of thick should display,
since the rule "body {border-top-width: thick;}" applies.
