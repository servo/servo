<h3>
This h3 heading has a border right width of 15px, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border right width of 45px; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-right-width: 15px;}"
"em {border-right-width: 45px;}"
So the border right width property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border right width property of 30px (because of the
rule "h4 {border-right-width: 30px;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border right width of UA-default, because the border-right-width
property does not inherit. 
However, the border right width property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

This blockquote element should have a UA-default border right width.  The
