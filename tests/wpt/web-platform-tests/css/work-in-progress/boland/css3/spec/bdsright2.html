<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have solid border right style.  The body's border right style of groove should display,
since the rule "body {border-right-style: groove}" applies.
Also "body {border-right-width: 30px;}" applies to indicate this more effectively.
