<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have 10px 20px border radius.  The body's border radius of 50cm should display,
since the rule "body {border-radius: 50cm;}" applies.
Border style of solid is applied to all
CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
