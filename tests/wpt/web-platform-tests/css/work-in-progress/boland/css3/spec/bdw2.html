<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have 15px border width.  Border style of solid is applied to all
CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
The body's border width of 20px should display,
since the rule "body {border-width: 20px;}" applies.
