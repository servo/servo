PASS CRITERIA:

NOTE: This property may not be implemented yet.
<p>
If statement above is correct, this paragraph should have 0
border radius.  A CSS rule of "border-style: solid" is applied.  However, the
border radius property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border radius of 20px 0px, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border radius of 10px; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-radius: 20px 0px;}"
"em {border-radius: 10px;}"
So the border radius property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border radius property of 100mm 50mm (because of the
rule "h4 {border-radius: 100mm 50mm;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border radius of "0", because the border-radius
property does not inherit.  
So the border radius property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border radius.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-radius: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-radius property does apply to the blockquote element.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border style of solid is applied
to all CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
