ATAG 2.0 Tester (Author) Template (Form) 32-3 - for Success Criterion 3.2
</h1>
<p>
This form is divided into four parts: Part 1 - General Information, Part 2 - General Questions,
Part 3 - Specific Questions, and Part 4 - Supplemental Questions.  NOTE: The (link to) ATAG2.0
techniques may be included in Part 3 questions, but there may be other questions to answer in Part 3.
Therefore, the questions may need to be reorganized, so that for some questions, every question
may need to be answered, but for others, only one out of a set of questions (related to ATAG2.0
techniques) may need to be answered.  If you need any additional help (for example, steps to take
or resources to access) in order to answer any of the questions following, please email:
(mailto) public-atag-tests@w3.org.  It is desired that this form be easy and quick to fill out.

<p>
DISCLAIMER: Data entered on this form is informative only.  The submitter bears all responsibility for the
accuracy of the data.  The data entered on this form 
may be reviewed by the W3C AUWG?
<p>
 Answers to all questions are
required (except for those questions marked OPTIONAL)(however, you may refer to answers on other templates if you wish); if you feel a question is not applicable, just write "not applicable" and
specify why.  If you need additional ATAG information (including access to the ATAG2.0 spec and techniques) to complete this form, you may go
to the ATAG site.  If you need additional WAI testing resources, go to ?  Please submit this form to "testreport site".  This information
will be made public.  This information will be made accessible.  After submitting this form, you may proceed directly to
the <a href="atag-tester-form33-3.htm">Tester Form for Success Criterion 3.3-3</a>, or back to the <a href="ATAG20testsuite.htm">
main ATAG test page</a>.  It is possible that some results may be machine-reportable, in
which case the developer should have noted this information on the developer's form (link?), and you
could attach the machine-reportable results to this form.  There are no dependencies on other tester forms
 for filling out this form.  Thank you.

<h3>TEST PURPOSE:</h3> To evaluate an authoring tool's formats according to SC3.2

<h3>TEST AGAINST:</h3> Success Criterion 3.2 - 
<ul>
<li>The authoring tool must always provide a check (automated check, semi-automated check or
manual check) for each applicable requirement to conform to WCAG Level AAA
<li>The authoring tool must always infomr the author of any failed check results prior to completion
of authoring 
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Despite prompting assistance from the tool (see Checkpoint 3.1), accessibility problems may still be introduced. For example, the author may cause accessibility problems by hand coding or by opening content with existing accessibility problems for editing. In these cases, the prompting and assistance mechanisms that operate when markup is added or edited (i.e. insertion dialogs and property windows) must be backed up by a more general checking system that can detect and alert the author to problems anywhere within the content (e.g. attribute, element, programmatic object, etc.). It is preferable that this checking mechanisms be well integrated with correction mechanisms (see Checkpoint 3.3), so that when the checking system detects a problem and informs the author, the tool immediately offer assistance to the author.

<li>The checkpoints in guideline 4 require that implementations of checking be: [@@expand this ? - could be techniques? - needs more emphasis and visibility@@]
    <ul>
    <li>clearly available to the author (checkpoint 4.3) [Priority 2]
    <li> configurable (checkpoint 4.X) [Priority 2]
    <li> integrated into the workflow of Web Content development (checkpoint 4.1) [Priority 2]
    <li> naturally integrated into the appearance and interactive style of the tool (checkpoint 4.4) [Priority 3]
    </ul>
<li> The authoring tool must always provide a check (automated check, semi-automated check or manual check) for each applicable requirement to conform to WCAG.

<li>Automate as much checking as possible. Where necessary provide semi-automated checking. Where neither of these options is reliable, provide manual checking.
<ul>
        <li> Automated: In automated checking, the tool is able to check for accessibility problems automatically, with no human intervention required. This type of check is usually appropriate for checks of a syntactic nature, such as the use of deprecated elements or a missing attribute, in which the meaning of text or images does not play a role.

         <li>   Example 3.2.1(a): This illustration shows a summary interface for a code-based authoring tool that displays the results of an automated check. (Source: mockup by AUWG)
            [longdesc missing]

         <li>   Example 3.2.1(b): This illustration shows an interface that displays the results of an automated check in a WYSIWYG authoring view using blue squiggly highlighting around or under rendered elements, identifying accessibility problems for the author to correct.

          <li>  Example 3.2.1(c): This illustration shows an authoring interface of an automated check in a code-level authoring view. In this view, the text of elements with accessibility problems is shown in a blue font, instead of the default black font. (Source: mockup by AUWG)

        <li> Semi-Automated: In semi-automated checking, the tool is able to identify potential problems, but still requires human judgment by the author to make a final decision on whether an actual problem exists. Semi-automated checks are usually most appropriate for problems that are semantic in nature, such as descriptions of non-text objects, as opposed to purely syntactic problems, such as missing attributes, that lend themselves more readily to full automation.

         <li>   Example 3.2.1(d): This illustration shows a dialog box that appears once the tool has detected an image without a description attribute. However, since not all images require description, the author is prompted to make the final decision. The author can confirm the at this is indeed an accessibility problem and move on to the repair stage by choosing "Yes". (Source: mockup by AUWG)

        <li> Manual: In manual checking, the tool provides the author with instructions for detecting a problem, but does not automate the task of detecting the problem in any meaningful way. As a result, the author must decide on their own whether or not a problem exists. Manual checks are discouraged because they are prone to human error, especially when the type of problem in question may be easily detected by a more automated utility, such as an element missing a particular attribute.

         <li>   Example 3.2.1(e): This illustration shows a dialog box that reminds the author to check if there are any words in other languages in the document. The author can move on to the repair stage by pressing "Yes". (Source: mockup by AUWG)
