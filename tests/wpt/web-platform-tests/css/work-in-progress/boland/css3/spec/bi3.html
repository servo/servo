<title>CSS3 Background Image Test</title>

<style type="text/css">
p {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)}
body {background-image: none}
h3 {background-image: url(ovalbbut.gif)}
blockquote {background-image: 200%}
em,i {background-image: none}
</style>
</head>

<body>




<h1>CSS3 Background Image Test</h1>





<ul>
<li >
For "background-image", initial is "none", it applies to all elements,
it is not inherited, percentage values are N/A, media is visual, and computed value is
absolute URI.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement above is true, this page should have no background
image.  The rule applied is "body {background-image: none}".
However, this
paragraph should have a flag pattern as a background image.
This is because of the rule "p {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)}".
So the background image property applies to the elements "p" and "body",
and "p" does not inherit this property from its parent "body".
Here is some more text to test this more effectively.

<h3>
This h3 element should have green oval buttons as its background image.
This is because of the rule "h3 {background-image: url(ovalbbut.gif)}".
So the background-image property does apply to the h3 element.

<h4>
This h4 element should have no background image.  No explicit CSS rules
are applied to this element, and it does not inherit from its parent "body".
However, the background-image property does apply to the h4 element.
Similarly, this <em>emphasized text</em> and <i>italicized text</i>
should have a background image of "none"; the rules applied are:
"em, i {background-image: none}", so the background image property
does apply to the em and i elements.

This blockquote element should have no background image.  The nonsensical
rule "blockquote {background-image: 200%}", should be ignored, and so the
UA-default should preside.
However, the background image property does apply to the blockquote element.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph like the one above.
However, it is not long enough to have a background image.
