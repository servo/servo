<ul>
<li >
For "border-right-color", initial is the value of the "color" property,
 it applies to all elements,
it is not inherited, percentage values are N/A, media is visual, and computed value
is "color".
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement above is correct, this paragraph should be UA-default
border right color.  A CSS rule of "border-right-style: solid" is applied.  However, the
border right color property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border right color of aqua, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border right color of green; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-right-color: aqua;}"
"em {border-right-color: green}"
So the border right color property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border right color property of silver (because of the
rule "h4 {border-right-color: silver}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border right color of UA-default, because the border-right-color
property does not inherit.  
So the border right color property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border right color.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-right-color: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-right-color property does apply to the blockquote element.

<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border right style of solid is applied to
all CSS rules, so that right border is visible.
