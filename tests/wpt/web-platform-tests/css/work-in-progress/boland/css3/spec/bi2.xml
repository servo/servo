PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement above is true, this paragraph should have no background
image of itself.  The rule applied is "p {background-image: none}".
However, the background of the entire page should be a flag pattern;
this is because of the rule "body {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)}".
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
