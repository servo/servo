<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
NOTE: This property may not be implemented yet.
<p>
If statement above is correct, this paragraph should have border (default)
background clip.  Background color is green.  However, the
background clip property does apply to the p element.
Border for p element is 50px dashed, since rules "p {border-style: dashed;
border-width: 50px;}" are applied.
Rule applied is "p {background-color: green}".
Also padding is 0 since rule "p {padding: 0:}" is applied.
</p>
<h3>
This h3 heading has a background clip of border, with a flag background.
Also 100px dotted border and 0 padding.
Rule applied is
"h3 {background-image: url(flagbg.gif);}"
Also "h3 {background-clip: border}".
Also "h3 {border-width: 100px; border-style: dotted; padding: 0;}".
So the background clip property applies to the h3  element.

This h4 heading has a background clip property of padding (0) and a background
image of oval button.  Rules applied are "h4 {background-clip: padding;}"
and "h4 {background-image: url(ovalbbut.gif):}".
Also "h4 {padding: 0;}".
<strong>
This strong text should have background clip property of border applied, because
of rule "strong {background-clip: border;}";  this property does apply to
the strong element.
The background-clip property is not inherited.
This is end of strong text.
</strong>
Anyway, the background clip property does apply to the h4 element.
