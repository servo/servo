NOTE: This property may not be implemented yet.
<p>

box shadow of "none".  A CSS rule of "border-style: solid" is applied.  However, the
box shadow property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a box shadow of 5mm aqua, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a box shadow of 10em 5em 20em green; the rules applied are:
"h3 {box-shadow: 5mm aqua;}"
"em {box-shadow: 10em 5em 20em green}"
So the box shadow property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a box shadow property of 10px 20px (because of the
rule "h4 {box-shadow: 10px 20px;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a box shadow of "none", because the box-shadow
property does not inherit.  
So the box shadow property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default box shadow.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {box-shadow: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the box-shadow property does apply to the blockquote element.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border style of solid is applied
to all CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
