ATAG 2.0 Tester (Author) Template (Form) 24-3 - for Success Criterion 2.4
</h1>
<p>
This form is divided into four parts: Part 1 - General Information, Part 2 - General Questions,
Part 3 - Specific Questions, and Part 4 - Supplemental Questions.  NOTE: The (link to) ATAG2.0
techniques may be included in Part 3 questions, but there may be other questions to answer in Part 3.
Therefore, the questions may need to be reorganized, so that for some questions, every question
may need to be answered, but for others, only one out of a set of questions (related to ATAG2.0
techniques) may need to be answered.  If you need any additional help (for example, steps to take
or resources to access) in order to answer any of the questions following, please email:
(mailto) public-atag-tests@w3.org.  It is desired that this form be easy and quick to fill out.
<hr>
<h2>Part 1 - General Information</h2>
<p>
DISCLAIMER: Data entered on this form is informative only.  The submitter bears all responsibility for the
accuracy of the data.  The data entered on this form 
may be reviewed by the W3C AUWG?
<p>
 Answers to all questions are
required (except for those questions marked OPTIONAL)(however, you may refer to answers on other templates if you wish); if you feel a question is not applicable, just write "not applicable" and
specify why.  If you need additional ATAG information (including access to the ATAG2.0 spec and techniques) to complete this form, you may go
to the ATAG site.  If you need additional WAI testing resources, go to ?  Please submit this form to "testreport site".  This information
will be made public.  This information will be made accessible.  After submitting this form, you may proceed directly to
the <a href="atag-tester-form31-3.htm">Tester Form for Success Criterion 3.1-3</a>, or back to the <a href="ATAG20testsuite.htm">
main ATAG test page</a>.  It is possible that some results may be machine-reportable, in
which case the developer should have noted this information on the developer's form (link?), and you
could attach the machine-reportable results to this form.  There are no dependencies on other tester forms
 for filling out this form.  Thank you.

<h3>TEST PURPOSE:</h3> To evaluate an authoring tool's formats according to SC2.4

<h3>TEST AGAINST:</h3> Success Criterion 2.4 - 

Any Web content (e.g., templates, clip art, example pages, etc.) that is bundled with the authoring tool
or preferentially licensed to the users of the authoring tool (i.e., provided for free or sold at a discount), must
conform to WCAG Level AAA when inserted.
