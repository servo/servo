All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have 10px border bottom width.  Border bottom style of solid is applied to all CSS rules,
so that bottom border is visible.  The body's bottom border width of thick should display,
since the rule "body {border-bottom-width: thick;}" applies.
