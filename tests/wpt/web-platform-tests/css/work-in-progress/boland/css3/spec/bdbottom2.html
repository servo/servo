<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have thick border bottom. 
The body's border bottom of yellow should display,
since the rule "body {border-bottom: yellow}" applies (initial value for border-width).
Also "body {border-bottom-style: solid;} is applied.
