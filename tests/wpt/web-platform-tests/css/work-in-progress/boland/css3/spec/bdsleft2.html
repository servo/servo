All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have dashed border left style.  The body's border left style of groove should display,
since the rule "body {border-left-style: groove;}" applies.   The rule "body {border-width: 50px;}"
is applied, to show the groove more effectively.
