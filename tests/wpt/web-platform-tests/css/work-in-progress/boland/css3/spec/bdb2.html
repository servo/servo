All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have 50px border break.  The body's border break of none should display,
since the rule "body {border-break: none}" applies.
Border style of solid is applied to body, p, h3, h4,
and em elements via CSS rule "{border-style: solid;}", so that the border is visible.
