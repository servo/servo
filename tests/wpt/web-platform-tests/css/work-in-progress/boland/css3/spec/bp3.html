This paragraph should have a flag pattern at the top center of the element.
The rule applied is "p {background-position: top}".
Thus the background-position property applies to block-level elements.

<em>
This emphasized text should have no background image and thus
not background position since the background position property is not
inherited, and 'em" is a child of "p".
However, the parent's image may shine through by default.

More paragraph text follows.
The image below should have a flag pattern background in the center, behind
an oval button image.
The rule applied is "img {background-position: center}".
Thus the background-position property applies to replaced elements.
<img src="ovalbbut.gif"/>
The img tag is "img src="ovalbbut.gif".

<p>
Note that the rule "blockquote,p,img,h3 {background-image: url(flagbg.gif)"
also applies here.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph like above (however, may be too short for image).
Also rules "blockquote,p,img,h3 {background-repeat: no-repeat;
                                 background-color: aqua}" are applied.
