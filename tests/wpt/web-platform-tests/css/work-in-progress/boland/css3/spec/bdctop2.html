All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have blue border top color.  Border top style of solid is applied to all CSS
rules, so that top border is visible.  The body's top border color of
 yellow should display, since the rule "body {border-top-color: yellow}" applies.
