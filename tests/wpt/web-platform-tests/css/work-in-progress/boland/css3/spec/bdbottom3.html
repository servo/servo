<h3>
This h3 heading has a border bottom of aqua solid 50px, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border bottom of 5px dotted green; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-bottom: aqua solid 50px;}"
"em {border-bottom: 5px dotted green;}"
So the border bottom property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border bottom property of 5mm silver dashed (because of the
rule "h4 {border-bottom: 5mm silver dashed;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border bottom of (initial values of individual properties)(no specific CSS rules
applied to "i" element), because the border-bottom
property does not inherit.  
However, the border bottom property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

This blockquote element should have a UA-default border bottom.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-bottom: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-bottom property does apply to the blockquote element.

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Also, the body's border bottom should be solid red,
because of the rule "body {border-bottom: solid red;}".
