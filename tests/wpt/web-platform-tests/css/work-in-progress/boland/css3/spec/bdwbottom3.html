border bottom width property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border bottom width of thin, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border bottom width of thick; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-bottom-width: thin;}"
"em {border-bottom-width: thick;}"
So the border bottom width property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border bottom width property of medium (because of the
rule "h4 {border-bottom-width: medium;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border bottom width of UA-default, because the border-bottom-width
property does not inherit.  
So the border bottom width property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border bottom width.  The

All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border bottom style of solid is applied to all
CSS rules, so that bottom border is visible.
