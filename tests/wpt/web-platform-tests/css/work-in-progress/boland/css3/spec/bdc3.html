PASS CRITERIA:

border color.  A "border-style: solid" CSS rule is applied.  However, the
border color property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border color of aqua, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border color of green; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-color: aqua;}"
"em {border-color: green}"
So the border color property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border color property of silver (because of the
rule "h4 {border-color: silver}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border color of UA-default, because the border-color
property does not inherit.  
So the border color property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border color.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-color: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-color property does apply to the blockquote element.

<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border style of solid is applied
to all elements, so that the border is visible.
