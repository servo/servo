All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have blue border right color.  Border right style of solid is applied to all
CSS rules, so that right border is visible. The body's right border color of
 yellow should display, since the rule "body {border-right-color: yellow}" applies.
