<h1>CSS3 Background Repeat Test</h1>





<ul>
<li >

<h2>

<p>

(this is paragraph-may not be long enough for background image)
</p>
<blockquote>
This blockquote should have a flag pattern with a repeating pattern.
The rules applied are: "blockquote {background-image: url(flagbg.gif);
                                    background-repeat: }".
Since there is no value specified for background-repeat, the initial
value (repeat) is used.
Also, the background-repeat property applies to the blockquote element.

<p>
This paragraph has a NIST image that is repeated in the horizontal 
direction.
The rule applied is "p {background-repeat: repeat-x}".
Also, "p {background-image: url(nist.gif)}"
So the background-repeat property applies to the "p" element.
<em> This emphasized text within this paragraph has no repeating
background image, because the "background-repeat" property does not
inherit, and "em" is a descendant of "p".
However, the background-repeat property does apply to the 
"em" element.
The parent's repeat and image may shine through by default.

<h3>
This h3 heading has an oval button image which should be repeated
according to the UA-default property (repeat?).  The nonsensical rule applied
is "h3 {background-repeat: 200%}", and since percentages do not
apply, this rule shuld be ignored.  However, the background-repeat
property does apply to the h3 element.
Also, "h3 {background-image: url(ovalbbut.gif)}".
