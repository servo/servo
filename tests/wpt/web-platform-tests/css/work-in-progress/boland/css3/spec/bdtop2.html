<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have thick border top.
The body's border top of yellow should display,
since the rule "body {border-top: yellow}" applies (initial value for border-width).
Also "body {border-top-style: solid;} is applied.
