<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>

border width.  A CSS rule of "border-style: solid" is applied.  However, the
border width property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border width of thin, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border width of 10px; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-width: thin;}"
"em {border-width: 10px;}"
So the border width property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border width property of thick (because of the
rule "h4 {border-color: thick;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border width of UA-default, because the border-width
property is not inherited.  
So the border width property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border width.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-width: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-width property does apply to the blockquote element.

<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border style of solid is applied
to all CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
