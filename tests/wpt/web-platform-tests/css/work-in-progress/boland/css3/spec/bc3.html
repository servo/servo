<h1>CSS3 Background Color Test</h1>





<ul>
<li >
For "background-color", initial is "transparent", it applies to all elements,
it is not inherited, percentage values are N/A, media is visual, and computed value
is as specified.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p>
If statement above is correct, this paragraph should be transparent
background color.  No specific CSS rules are applied.  However, the
background color property does apply to the p element.
</p>
<h3>
This h3 heading has a background color of aqua, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a background color of green; the rules applied are:
"h3 {background-color: aqua;}"
"em {background-color: green}"
So the background color property applies to the h3 and em elements.
</h3>
<h4>
This h4 heading has a background color property of silver (because of the
rule "h4 {background-color: silver}", but these <strong>strong words</strong>
have a background color of "transparent", because the background-color
property does not inherit.  However, the parent's background color may
shine through by default.
So the background color property does apply to the h4 and strong elements.
</h4>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default background color.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {background-color: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the background-color property does apply to the blockquote element.
</blockquote>
<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.
