<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have blue box shadow.  The body's box shadow of 10px 20px 30px (UA-default color) should display,
since the rule "body {box-shadow: 10px 20px 30px;}" applies.
Border style of solid is applied to all
CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
