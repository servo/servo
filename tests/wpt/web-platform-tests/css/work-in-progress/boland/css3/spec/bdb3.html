NOTE: This property may not be implemented yet.

border break of "none".  A CSS rule of "border-style: solid" is applied.  However, the
border break property does apply to the p element.

<h3>
This h3 heading has a border break of wave, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border break of 10px dashed; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-break: wave;}"
"em {border-break: 10px dashed;}"
So the border break property applies to the h3 and em elements.

<h4>
This h4 heading has a border break property of 17mm (because of the
rule "h4 {border-break: 17mm;}", but these <i>italicized words</i>
have a border break of "17mm", because the border-break
property does inherit.  
So the border break property does apply to the h4 and i elements.

<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a UA-default border break.  The
nonsensical rule "blockquote {border-break: 200%}" should be ignored,
but the border-break property does apply to the blockquote element.
Border-style of solid is also applied.

<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above.  Border style of solid is applied
to all h4 CSS rules, so that the border is visible.
