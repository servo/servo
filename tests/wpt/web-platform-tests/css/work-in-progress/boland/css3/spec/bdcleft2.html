<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
This is a paragraph, like the one above, so should also
have blue border left color.  Border left style of solid is applied to all CSS rules,
so that left border is visible.  The body's border left color of yellow should display,
since the rule "body {border-left-color: yellow}" applies.
