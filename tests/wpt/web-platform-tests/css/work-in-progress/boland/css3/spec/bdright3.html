<h3>
This h3 heading has a border right of aqua solid 50px, but this <em>emphasized text
</em> has a border right of 5px dotted green; the rules applied are:
"h3 {border-right: aqua solid 50px;}"
"em {border-right: 5px dotted green;}"
So the border right property applies to the h3 and em elements.

"i" element), because the border-right
property does not inherit.
