PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<P>
If statement #2 above is passed, then
this paragraph should be red.
The rule applied is "p {color: red}".
This p is lower-case, but the P element for this paragraph is upper-case;
however, it doesn't matter for HTML.
This <em>emphasized text</em> should be blue, because of rule
"p em {color: blue}".
</p>
<em> This emphasized text should be green, because of rule
"em {color: green}".
</em>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
