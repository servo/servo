NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY DRAFT, AND MAY BE OBSOLETED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME
<p>


These tests evaluate the ability of browsers to render CSS2 information according
to accepted behavior.
The tests are given as examples.  There is one test case
included for each testable statement of the CSS2 specification.
Not included are informative units, or units for which there were no
testable statements.  It is attempted to use the same style sheets within each
section, to limit what is being tested.  The purpose of these tests is to
compare CSS2 implementations against the CSS2 specification, or to demonstrate
interoperability of CSS2 implementations from different vendors.

<p>
Each test has one or more style sheets, a testable statement, 
a heading describing the test, and a pass criterion 
The "pass criterion" portion covers the style sheet implementation; the rest of
the page is just HTML or XML.
This is again to limit what is being tested for each test and to control the
test environment.
The tests assume that no personal stylesheets are being used(except where
indicated); in addition, other factors may affect
whether or not the tests are passed.
The tests should be able to
stand alone, or be used in combination.
Also, it is possible to test more than one testable statement in a single test
case, although this has not been done here.
One should know by looking directly at the browser's rendition
whether a test has been passed, although it is possible to look at the
source code also.

<p>
You have the ability to enter your test information, view previous test results,comment on particular tests, or propose new tests.  Results 
of the tests are available to any visitor to the site.


<p>
Running your browser through the test suite is a way for you to contribute to
the collective knowledge of the Web development community.  When you participate,
you will be offered a series of tests, each of which depicts a particular CSS2
statement.  You will be asked to indicate whether your browser seems to render
the CSS2 according to acceptable behavior.
<p>

You may take one, some, or all of the tests.  There are many tests included
here under development.  The syntax of the test name is "xxx-y.htm", where "xxx"refers to the CSS2 structural unit, and "y" refers to the position of the 
testable statement within that unit.  To take a test, just click on the test
name, and a rendition should appear on your screen.
The XML tests have a separate syntax.

Comments are appreciated.  This is a preliminary draft ( a strawman), being
made available for public review and comment.  Please send comments to:
frederick.boland@nist.gov, or to the www-style mailing list.  These tests are
not complete.
<p>

CSS1 capability is tested, as well as additional CSS2 functionality beyond
what was in CSS1 (Appendix B.2 of CSS2).  In addition, semantic differences
in interpretation in CSS2 from CSS1 (Appendix B.3 of CSS2) are tested - these
tests are specially designated.
WHERE CSS1 TESTS ARE USED, IT IS INDICATED EXPLICITLY.
