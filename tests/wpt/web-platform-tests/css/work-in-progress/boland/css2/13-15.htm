7. The marks property has initial none, it applies to page context, 
inherited and percentages are N/A, and media is visual, paged.
</ul>




<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p  >
If statement #7 above is passed, then
this page box should have marks of none (initial value).  No explicit CSS
rule is applied.
<p>
This page box should have crop marks.
Rule applied is "@page {marks: crop}".
This <em>emphasize text</em> should also have marks of UA-default, since
inherited is N/A, and em is a child of p element.
<p >
This page should have cross marks.
Rule applied is "@page {marks: cross}".
<p>
This page box should have marks of none.
Rule applied is "@page {marks: none}".
<p>
This page box should have marks of inherit.
Rule applied is "@page {marks: inherit}".
<p>
This page box should have marks of UA-default.
Rule specified is "@page {marks: 200%}, but percentages are N/A.
<p>
From above, it is apparent that marks property applies only to page context.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
Your browser rendering of this page should look similar to this <a href="c1212.gif"> 
reference image </a> or to this <a href="d1212.gif">reference image</a>.
