PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p class="note">
If statement #2 above is passed, then
a solid green border should be rendered around the entire paragraph,
including the initial string "Note: ".
Rule applied is "P.note:before { content: "Note: " }".
Also "P.note {border: solid green}".
<p>
This paragraph should not have the string "Note: " inserted, since there
is no class attribute with value "note".
<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
