PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p class="note">
If statement #1 above is passed, then
the string "Note: " is inserted before the content of this P element, 
because the "class" attribute has the value "note".
Rule applied is "P.note:before { content: "Note: " }".
<p>
This paragraph should not have the string "Note: " inserted, since there
is no class attribute with value "note".
<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
