Testing 26th Testable Statement of Sec 5.1 of CSS2 Specification

<ul>
<li  >
26. The CSS1 description of inside (for list-style-position) allowed the
interpretation that the left margin of the text was affected, rather than
the position of the bullet.  In CSS2 that interpretation is ruled out.
