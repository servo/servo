3. The volume property has initial medium, it applies to all elements,
it is inherited, and percentage values are relative to inherited value.
</ul>




<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >

If statement #3 above is passed, this paragraph should have a volume
of medium.
The rule applied is "p {volume }".
So the volume property applies to the "p" element.
<h3>
This h3 element should have a volume of x-soft
<em>
This emphasized text should have a volume of x-soft, since the 
volume property is inherited, and "em" is a child of 'h3".
No explicit rule is applied for "em".
</em>
THe rule applied is 'h3 {volume: x-soft}".
So the volume property applies to em and h3.
</h3>
<h4>
THis h4 element should have a volume which is loud.
The rule applied is "h4 {volume: loud}".
So the volume property applies to h4.
</h4>

<strong>
This strong text should have a volume of x-loud
; so the volume property applies
to the strong element.
The rule applied is "strong {volume: x-loud}".
(NOTE: Should other HTML elements be mentioned?)
</strong>
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have a volume of 200% of that
of its parent (body element).
The rule applied is "blockquote {volume: 200%}".
</blockquote>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
