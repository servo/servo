<ul>

7. The size property has initial auto, it applies to the page context,
inherited and percentages are N/A, and media is visual, paged.

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p  >
If statement #7 above is passed, then
this page should have a size of auto (initial value).  No explicit CSS
rule applied.
<p>
This page should have a size of 2cm.
The rule applied is "@page {size: 2cm}".
This <em>emphasized text</em> should have page size of UA-default, because
inherited is N/A, and em is a child of p element.
<p >
This page box should have page size of 2cm and 4cm.
The rule applied is "@page {size: 2cm 4cm}".
<p >
This page box should have a size of auto.
The rule applied is "@page {size: auto}".
<p >
This page box should have a size of portrait.
The rule applied is "@page{size: portrait}".
<p >
This page should have a size of landscape.
The rule applied is "@page {size: landscape}".
<p>
This page should have size of inherit.
The rule applied is "@page {size: inherit}".
<p>
This page size should be UA-default.
Rule specified is "@page {size: 200%}", which is N/A.
<p>
From list above, it is apparent that size property applies only to page
context.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
