                        DRAFT BROWSER TEST CASES FOR
                        CASCADING STYLE SHEET LEVEL 2
                           (CSS2) SPECIFICATION -
                        WORLD WIDE WEB CONSORTIUM
                               -02/20/98

NOTE: THIS IS A PRELIMINARY DRAFT, AND MAY BE OBSOLETED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME
<p>


Tests below evaluate the ability of browsers to render CSS2 information according
to accepted behavior.
The tests below are given as examples.  There is one test case
included for each testable statement of the CSS2 specification.
Not included are informative units, or units for which there were no
testable statements.  It is attempted to use the same style sheets within each
section, to limit what is being tested.  The purpose of these tests is to
compare CSS2 implementations against the CSS2 specification, or to demonstrate
interoperability of CSS2 implementations from different vendors.

<p>
Each test has one or more style sheets, a testable statement, 
a heading describing the test, and a pass criterion (including one or more
reference snapshots for comparison).
The "pass criterion" portion covers the style sheet implementation; the rest of
the page is just HTML.
This is again to limit what is being tested for each test and to control the
test environment.
The tests assume that no personal stylesheets are being used, and User Agent
default information cannot be tested; in addition, other factors may affect
whether or not the tests are passed.
Various assumptions are made, including support for appropriate CSS2 
properties.
The tests should be able to
stand alone, or be used in combination.
Also, it is possible to test more than one testable statement in a single test
case, although this has not been done here.
One should know by looking directly at the browser's rendition and the comparison
snapshots whether a test has been passed, although it is possible to look at the
source code also.

<p>
You have the ability to enter your test information, view previous test results,comment on particular tests, or propose new tests.  Results 
of the tests are available to any visitor to the site.


<p>
Running your browser through the test suite is a way for you to contribute to
the collective knowledge of the Web development community.  When you participate,
you will be offered a series of tests, each of which depicts a particular CSS2
fragment.  You will be asked to indicate whether your browser seems to render
the CSS2 according to acceptable behavior.
<p>
Help information is included below, in the sense that if one wants to test a
particular function, there is a mapping of that function to tests for it below.
In addition, there is a reference parser under development for CSS2.

<p>
You may take one, some, or all of the tests.  There are some 220 tests included
here under development.  The syntax of the test name is "xxx-y.htm", where "xxx"refers to the CSS2 structural unit, and "y" refers to the position of the 
testable statement within that unit.  To take a test, just click on the test
name, and a rendition should appear on your screen.
<p>

Comments are appreciated.  This is a preliminary draft ( a strawman), being
made available for public review and comment.  Please send comments to:
frederick.boland@nist.gov, or to the www-style mailing list.  These tests are
not complete.  NOTE: The reference images displayed in each test are samples only.
The tests need to be customized for each particular purpose.
<p>

Functionality included here is from Appendix B of the CSS2 draft, given as

If you wish, you can assign your browser a score by comparing your browser rendition
against the reference images and descriptions of how the rendering should appear.
Your score may range from 1 (poor-totally dissimilar) to 10 (excellent-exactly
the same).  Things to consider include degree of similarity in color,
positioning, and general appearance.

Thank you very much.
