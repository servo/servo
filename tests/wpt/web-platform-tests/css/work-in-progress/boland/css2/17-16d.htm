Testing Seventh Testable Statement of Sec 17.6 of CSS2 Specification
</h1>


<ul>
<li  >
7. The empty-cells property has initial show, it applies to table
cell elements, it is inherited, percentages are N/A, and media
is visual.
</ul>




<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #7 above is passed, then
in the first table below the empty-cells value is show (initial
value).
The rule applied is "#id1 {empty-cells:}".
The second table below has a empty-cells value of show.
The rule applied there is "#id2 {empty-cells: show}".
Note that this table has included table also with empty-cells of 
show, since this property is inherited.
<table id=id1 >
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>
<table id=id2 >
<tr><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr>
<table>
<tr><td>a</td><td>b</td></tr>
</table>
</table>
The table below should have empty cells of UA-default.
The rule specified is "#id3 {empty-cells: 200%}".
This rule is ignored, since percentages do not apply.
<table id=id3>
<tr><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>12</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This paragraph should be UA-default.
The rule specified is "p {empty-cells: hide}", which is ignored
since the property only applies to table and inline-table elements.
</p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
