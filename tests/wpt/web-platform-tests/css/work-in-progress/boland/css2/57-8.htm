PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<h3 >
If statement #8 above is passed, then
this h3 heading should have a small vertical space between it and the h4
heading below; this is because of rule
"h3 + h4 {margin-top: -5mm}"
<h4>This is h4 heading
</h4>
<div>
<p>
This paragraph should not be indented, because p follows div, and
rule is "div + p {text-indent: 0}".
<h3 class="new">
This is h3 heading with class "new".
</h3>
<h4>
This is h4 heading that follows it.  Margin top should be 10mm, because
of rule "h3.new + h4 {margin-top: 10mm}".
<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
