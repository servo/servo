<P CLASS="one">This is a paragraph that has a <SPAN CLASS="two">very
long span in it, and the span has a 10px red border separated from the
span by 2pt, and a margin of 30pt.  The padding and border should be
present on all sides of the span (although vertical lines should appear
only at the beginning and the end of the whole span, not on each
line).  The padding, border, and margin should all be noticeable at the
beginning and end of the span.  However, the line height should not be
changed by any of them, so the margin should be unnoticeable and the
border should overlap text on other lines.</SPAN>  The line spacing in
the whole paragraph should be 200% of the font size.</P>

<P CLASS="three">This is a paragraph that has a <SPAN CLASS="four">very
long span in it, and the span has a 12px red border separated from the
span by 2pt of padding (the difference between the line-height and the
font-size), which should overlap with the lines of text above and below
the span, since the padding and border should not effect the line
height.  The span's border should have vertical lines only at the
beginning and end of the whole span, not on each line.</SPAN>  The line
spacing in the whole paragraph should be 12pt, with font-size 10pt.</P>
