6. User agents must ignore an invalid at-keyword together with everything
following it, up to and including the next semicolon or block.
</ul>

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #6 above is passed, then
the h1 heading above (Testing..) should have a color of blue.
The rules proposed are "@three-dee {@background-lighting {
But the whole rule in the curly braces is ignored; therefore, only the
following rule "h1 {color: blue}" is accepted.

<p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
