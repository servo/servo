PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p lang="en">
If statement #2 above is passed, then
this paragraph should have quote marks of * around it.
Rule applied is "p {quote:"*" "*"}".
This <em>emphasized text</em> should also have quote marks of * around,
since em is a child of p, and quotes property is inherited.
</p>
<Q>this quote</Q> should have English-style quotation marks.  The rule
applied is "Q:lang(en) {quotes: '"' '"' "'" "'" }".
<blockquote>
This blockquote element should have no quotes around.  
Rule applied is "blockquote {quote: none}".
</blockquote>
<h3>This h3 heading should have quote of inherit.
Rule applied is "h3 {quote: inherit}".
</h3>
<strong>This strong text should have quote marks of = around it.
Rule applied is "strong {quote: "=" "="}".
</strong>
<h4>
This h4 heading should have quote marks of $ around it.
Rule applied is "h4 {quote: "$" "$"}".
</h4>
<h5>
This h5 heading should have UA-defined (initial) value. 
Rule is "h5 {quote: 200%}", but percentages do not apply.
</h5>
From number of elements mentioned above, obvious that quotes property 
should apply to all elements.
