12. The page property has initial of auto, it applies to block-level elements,
it is inherited, percentages are N/A, and media is visual, paged.
</ul>




<h2 >
PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p   >
If statement #12 above is passed, then
all paragraphs will be on a right-hand side landscape page (named "rotated").
This <em>emphasized text</em> should be treated the same as the p element,
since the page property is inherited, and em is a child of p.
Rules applied are "@page rotated {size: landscape}".
Also "p {page: rotated}".
<div >
This div should have a page of narrow (9cm by 18cm).
The rule applied is "@page narrow {size: 9cm 18cm}", and
"div {page: narrow}".
<blockquote>
THis blockquote should have a page of auto.
The rule applied is "blockquote {page: auto}".
</blockquote>
<h3>
This h3 element should have page of UA-default.
The rule specified is "h3 {page: 200%}", which is ignored, since
percentages do not apply.
</h3>
<h4>
This h4 element should have page of auto (initial value).  No explicit CSS2
rule is applied.
</h4>
From above list, it is apparent that page property applies to all block-
level elements.
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
