<ul>

2. The speak-header property has initial once, it applies to table
header elements, it is inherited, percentages are N/A, and media
is aural.
</ul>

PASS CRITERIA:
</h2>
<p >
If statement #2 above is passed, then
in the first table below the speak-header value is once (initial
value).
The rule applied is "#id1 {speak-header:}".
The second table below has a speak-header value of once.
The rule applied there is "#id2 {speak-header: always}".
Note that this table has included table also with speak-header of 
always, since this property is inherited.
</p>
<table id=id1 >
<tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>
<table id=id2 >
<tr><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>a</td><td>b</td></tr>
<table>
<tr><td>c</td><td>d</td></tr>
</table>
</table>
The table below should have speak-header of UA-default.
The rule specified is "#id3 {speak-header: 200%}".
This rule is ignored, since percentages do not apply.
<table id=id3>
<tr><td>9</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>12</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
This paragraph should be UA-default.
The rule specified is "p {speak-header: always}", which is ignored
since the property only applies to table header elements.
</p>
All other properties of this page should be UA-default.
