no explicit CSS rule defined for em.  em is a child of p, and counter-
reset is not inherited.
</p>
<strong>This strong text should have counter-reset of none (initial value);
rule applied is "strong:before {content: "strong " counter();counter-increment: 4}"
</strong>
<blockquote>

of 'quote' and counter-reset of "word".
