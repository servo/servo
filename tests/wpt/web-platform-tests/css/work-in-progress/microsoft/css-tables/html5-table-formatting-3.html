	<h1>HTML5 Table Formatting algorithm (row/column grid computation)</h1>
	<p>Verifies how browsers deal with implicit tracks from which no cell does originate</p>

	<hr/>
	<p>This should be a 100px by 100px blue square:</p>
	<p>The table grid is 1x1, so the table is not empty and follows step 3A of the table layout algorithm (which adds anonymous cell boxes)</p>
	<p>The consecutive tracks were merged together because they are not all defined explicitely by a table-column or a table-row, and share the same set of cells</p>
	<p>Two 25px border-spacing causes the addition of 50px (track is 50x50)</p>
	<x-table style="background: blue; border-spacing: 25px">
		<x-tr><x-td style="padding: 25px"></x-td></x-tr>
