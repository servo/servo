		<para>I'd like to say that I am not a CSS 
guru nor a CSS expert. I'm only a sensitive person who hates but still uses the web 
(aaw, such contradictions are stunning!). I hate it because it's completely alienating. 
I can stand it only a few minutes in the morning, when I check my mail and delete piles of spam messages. 
I love only the real world, namely what I can see with my real eyes, touch with my real hands and feel with 
my real heart. Yes, I use it, but only as a means for improving my job skills. 
Sometimes my sensitiveness really hurts me, so I have to read or do some technical stuff in order to smother it 
(maybe I'm too sensitive, but you get the idea). I'm sorry, but this is exactly the way I am. 
The truth is that I can't lie (wow, now we have piles of logical contradictions and romantic half-baked ideas!). 
By the way, I'm a Cancer and I believe in my profile. And yes, I am proud!</para>
