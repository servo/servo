  <meta content="This test checks that an element with 'contain: layout' will make such element create its own formatting context. In this test, the element with 'contain: layout' acts as if it has its own formatting context independent from div#floated-left element. In other words, the div#with-contain-layout is no longer required to flow its content around the div#floated-left element and current line boxes next to the float are no longer shortened to make room for the margin box of the float." name="assert">
