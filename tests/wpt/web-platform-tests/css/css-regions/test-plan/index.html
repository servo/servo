        This document is intended to be used as a guideline for the testing
        activities related to the CSS Regions spec [[!css3-regions]]. Its main
        goal is to provide an overview of the general testing areas, possible
        caveats and testing aspects not immediately apparent from the spec.
        Also, it provides a means of tracking the progress of the CSS Regions
        spec testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document is not meant to replace the spec in determining the
        normative and non-normative assertions to be tested, but rather
        complement it.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As CSS moved away from the monolithic development of CSS 2.1 to the
        modular development of CSS 3, the number of proposed new features and
        the complexity of the layout landscape have increased dramatically.
        While this directly translates to increased flexibility and agility in
        adopting and implementing new CSS features, it also increases the
        complexity of testing CSS features and the need for coordinating the
        testing efforts. Also, the need for testing coordination increases as
        crowd-sourcing efforts like
        <a href="http://testthewebforward.org/" target="_blank">Test the Web
        Forward</a> present people less familiar with the processes and policies
        of the W3C with the opportunity to contribute new tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except when defining new behaviors or redefining old behaviors, the
        implicit assumption for new CSS modules is that they play nicely with
        other modules or properties defined in CSS&nbsp;2.1 [[CSS21]]. As CSS
        Regions is a spec that touches many aspects of layout, styling and CSSOM,
        it's not unreasonable to want to test the spec against these implicit
        assumptions, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        This testing strategy document is meant to complement the CSS Regions
        spec and the existing test suite by providing an overview of the testing
        areas (especially the less apparent ones) and tracking the progress of
        the testing activities against these test areas.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure a comprehensive test suite with useful, high quality tests, a
        number of goals are proposed. They range from process goals (how to
        conduct testing) to implementation goals (how to write good tests).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Enabling easy test contribution</h3>
        <p>
          An important vector in successfully testing CSS Regions is to
          enable easy test contributions, both from W3C partners and from
          non-W3C members that wish to contribute. This is achieved by clearly
          marking and explaining the areas that need testing, linked to existing
          tests and general testing progress.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Providing guidance on testing</h3>
        <p>
          In order to increase the quality of the test contributions, this
          document offers a set of guidelines for conducting testing (see
          <a href="#approach" class="sectionRef"></a>) and a testing progress
          tracker to increase the surface coverage of tests (see
          <a href="#test-progress-tracking" class="sectionRef"></a>).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Creating automation-friendly tests</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of actual tests produced for the CSS Regions, the main goal
          is to ensure that most tests are automatable (i.e. they're either
          reftests or use <code>testharness.js</code>). Even where manual tests
          are absolutely necessary they should be written so that they can be
          easily automated &ndash; as there are on-going efforts to make
          WebDriver [[webdriver]] automated tests a first class citized in W3C
          testing. This means that even if a manual test requires user
          interaction, the validation or PASS/FAIL conditions should still be
          clear enough as to allow automatic validation if said interaction is
          later automated.
        </p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Risks and mitigation</h2>
      <p>
        There are a number of risks associated with creating a high-quality
        test suite for CSS Regions. The most important ones are listed below.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Implicit interactions with a lot of other specs (and commonly accepted
          browser behavior)</h3>
        <p>
          The CSS Region spec introduces a significant change in the way layout
          can be done and as a consequence, many of the assumptions that hold in
          the context of CSS&nbsp;2.1 must be re-validated in the context of CSS
          Regions. In the meanwhile, a lot of new layout modules have been
          proposed, with various degrees of implementor support and maturity.
          Also, non-CSS specific specs introduced concepts that affect how style
          is propagated (e.g. Shadow DOM [[shadow-dom]]) or how elements are
          rendered and interact with their containing documents (e.g.
          <code>&lt;iframe seamless&gt;</code> in HTML 5 [[HTML5]]).
        </p>
        <p>
          All the above factors increase the testing surface and the number of
          the possible cases that might need an explicitly specified behavior in
          order to ensure intuitive and predictable results as well as stable
          interaction with widely used browser features (that might not be <em>yet</em>
          so strictly specified).
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of specifying the expected behavior, the current approach is
          to try and specify it for specs that are final or nearly-final and to
          just make a note of the possible interactions and unspecified behaviors
          in the case of specs that are still in flux. In exceptional cases, a
          new spec might be created to cater for the needs of multiple specs
          (e.g. the CSS Fragmentation spec [[css3-break]]).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Big number of tests required</h3>
        <div class="note">
          Add here the estimation of tests required produced by
          <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/tools/coverage" target="_blank">W3C test coverage</a>
          tool. If possible, provide a better informed guess on the number of tests.
        </div>
        <p>
          Given the complexity of the spec, a big number of tests will need to
          be created to produce a test suite that can ensure interoperability
          between implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this context, the main purpose of this document is to provide
          useful informations for creating and contributing tests in an effective
          manner in terms of coverage and test quality.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        As spec testing cannot be realistically separated from testing a
        particular implementation (except for the very simple cases), the
        approach proposed for testing is one that tries to first cover as many
        areas as possible, instead of deep diving on a certain feature or aspect
        of the spec first. A side benefit of this approach is that the spec
        tests can be used at any time to gauge the level of support of a certain
        implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having this <em>breadth-first</em> approach in mind, tests will be
        created for the testing areas listed in <a href="#testing-areas"
        class="sectionRef"></a>. Testing will be done in multiple passes, each
        aimed at covering more specific edge-cases.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Testing areas</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Explicit testing areas</h3>
        <p>
          These are testing areas normatively defined by the spec. They cover
          things explicitly or implicitly defined in the CSS Regions spec.
          Please note that while detailed, this list is not necessarily
          exhaustive and normative behaviors may not be contained in it.
          When in doubt, consult the CSS Regions spec or ask a question on the
          <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">mailing
          list</a>.

          the spec (e.g. processing model, CSS 2.1 compliance, etc.).

          exhaustive and normative behaviors may not be contained in it.
