    <title>CSS Test: Testing min-width:auto</title>

<!--
     This testcase tests the used value of "min-width:auto" (the property's
     initial value) on flex items in a horizontal flex container.

     It's supposed to resolve to the smallest of:
      a) The used 'flex-basis' (taken from 'width'), if 'flex-basis' is at its
         initial value.
      b) The computed 'max-width' property
      c) If there's no intrinsic aspect ratio: the item's min-content width.
      d) If there is an intrinsic aspect ratio: the item's width derived from
         the ratio & constraints in the other dimension.

    We measure what the used value is by putting flex items in a small flex
    container, which will shrink its items down to their min-width.

    This test checks for situations where we should resolve the min-width as
    (d) above, with "constraints in the other dimension" being "height".

    <style>
      .flexbox {
        display: flex;
        width: 0px;  /* No available space; shrink flex items to min-width */
        margin-bottom: 2px; /* (Just for spacing things out, visually) */
      }

      .flexbox > * {
        /* Flex items have purple border: */
        border: 2px dotted purple;
        /* Flex items have sizing constraint in cross axis: */
        height: 30px;
      }
    </style>
