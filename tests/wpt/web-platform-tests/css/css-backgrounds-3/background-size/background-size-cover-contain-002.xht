  <meta name="assert" content="When 'background-size' is 'cover', then the background-image is scaled, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio (it is 1:1 in this test), to the smallest size such that both its width and its height can completely cover the background positioning area. When 'background-size' is 'contain', then the background-image is scaled, while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio (it is 1:1 in this test), to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area. In this test, the 2 background-images should be scaled to become 100px by 100px." />
