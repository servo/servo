<meta name="assert" content="When an orthogonal flow's parent doesn't have a definite block size and the nearest ancestor scroller does not have a fixed height but does have a fixed max-height, use that, making sure you stick with the content height.">

<p>Test passes if there is a <strong>green rectangle</strong> below and <strong>no red</strong>.

  the max-height of its parent, it should wrap just right for the green 0 to
  overlap with the red one. -->
