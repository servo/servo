<meta name="assert" content="When an orthogonal flow's parent doesn't have a definite block size and the nearest ancestor scroller does a have fixed height, use that whole height increased by min-height if that's larger, even if some other content already consumes some of it (same as -005, with min-height).">

body > div {
  font-family: monospace; /* to be able to reliably measure things in ch*/
  font-size: 20px;
  height: 4ch;
  min-height: 8ch;
  width: 300px; /* Shrinkwrapping this div is not what we're interested in testing here, so give it a width. See nested-orthogonal-001.html for that. */
  overflow: hidden;
  color: transparent;
  position: relative; /* to act as a container of #red */
}

div > div { padding-bottom: 2ch; } /* so that the content height of the parent and of the fixed size scrolling ancestor are different */
div > div > div { writing-mode: vertical-rl; }

span {
  background: green;
  display: inline-block; /* This should not change it's size or position, but makes the size of the background predictable*/
}

#red { /* Not necessary when when comparing to the reference, but makes human judgement easier */
  position: absolute;
  background: red;
  left: 0;
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  z-index: -1;
  top: 1ch;
}
#spacer { /* shrinks the remaining space of the parent div. */
  height: 1ch;
  width: 100%;
}

<p>Test passes if there is a <strong>green rectangle</strong> below and <strong>no red</strong>.

<div>
  <aside id="red">0</aside>
  <div><aside id="spacer"></aside><div>0 0 0 0 <span>0</span> 0 0 0</div></div>
  <!-- If the inner div take its height from the height of its scrollable
  ancestor, it should wrap just right for the green 0 to overlap with the red
  one. If instead it takes it size from the remaining height after having
  removed #spacer, or does some other calculation that takes #spacer into
  account, it won't line up with #red.-->
</div>
