  max-height: 100px;
  writing-mode: vertical-rl;
  /* Doing this with a horizontal div and max-width ought to result in the same 100x100 green square,
     but font rasterisation may (and in practice does) result in different aliasing artifacts.
     Therefore I am using the same writing mode as the test,
     to make sure we get identically sharp/fuzzy edges on the same sides.

<p>There should be a <strong>green square</strong> and <strong>no red</strong>.
