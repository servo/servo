		<!-- Individual list items are extracted from ordered/unordered lists. Some of them remain
		in the normal document flow while others are rendered in a region. Both the items that remain
		in the normal flow and items in the named flow should preserve their number/marks just as regions
		were not applied at all. -->
		<p>Test passes if you see two rectangles, one green and one blue, as described below:<br>
		The green rectangle should contain two lists, separated by a small vertical space. The <strong>first list</strong> should be a numbered list starting with 2 that has 2 items;  the <strong>second list</strong> should be a bullet list with 3 items, the last one being indented and with a different type of bullet.<br>
		The blue rectangle should contain a list with items numbered/marked in different ways, as follows. Except where noted, the numbers/markers should be <em>outside</em> the the blue rectangle. The <strong>first item</strong> should be numbered with the number 1, in decimal. The <strong>second item</strong> should be bulleted. The <strong>third and fourth items</strong> should be numbered with 2 and 1 respectively, with roman numerals. Also, the <strong>third item</strong> should be indented (with the number inside the blue rectangle). The <strong>fourth and fifth items</strong> should be bulleted, with the <strong>fourth item</strong> having a different kind of bullet than the second and fifth item.
