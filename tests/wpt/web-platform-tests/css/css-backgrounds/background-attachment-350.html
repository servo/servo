  <meta content="This test checks that when an element has 'background-attachment: local', then the background image is fixed with regard to what is the element's scrollable area and not to its viewport. In this test, what would be the scrollable area for the div element is where the red square is and such area is clipped due to 'overflow: hidden'." name="assert">

  <style>
  div
    {
      background-attachment: local;
      background-image: url("support/100x100-red.png");
      background-position: bottom right;
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      font-size: 100px;
      line-height: 1;
      height: 100px;
      overflow: hidden;
      width: 100px;
    }
  </style>

  <body>

  <p>Test passes if there is <strong>no red</strong>.

  <div id="target">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
