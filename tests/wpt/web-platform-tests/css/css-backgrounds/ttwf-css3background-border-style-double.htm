    <meta name="assert" content="'Border-style' is a shorthand for the other four. Its four values set the top, right, bottom and left border respectively. A missing left is the same as right, a missing bottom is the same as top, and a missing right is also the same as top. 'double': Two parallel solid lines with some space between them. (The thickness of the lines is not specified, but the sum of the lines and the space must equal 'border-width'.)" />
