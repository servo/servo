<title>Reference File for line breaking tests using ideographic caracters</title>

<!--
  As 口 is as a CJK ideograph, its advance is expected to be 1em,
  and as both background and color are green
  this file should typically render identically to line-breaking-001-ref.
  However, depending on the particular font available,
  the glyph could be missing or sized differently.

  Also, there may be and anti-aliasing / font rendering differences between
  a 1em × 1em green background (this file)
  and a 1em × 1em green glyph from the Ahem font (line-breaking-001-ref).

  Therefore, as both files are only likely, not certain, to render identically,
  we need both.
