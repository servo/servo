  <meta content="When 'hyphens' is set to 'manual' and applied to an inline element, then words can be hyphenated only if characters inside the words explicitly define hyphenation opportunities. In this test, the characters inside the word 'Deoxyribonucleic' explicitly define 4 hyphenation opportunities. Since 'Deoxy' has 5 characters and 'Deoxyribo' has 9 characters and since the content width of the block box can take 8 characters, then a soft hyphen will occur after 'Deoxy'. Since 'ribonu' has 6 characters and 'ribonucleic' has 11 characters and since the content width of the block box can take 8 characters, then a soft hyphen will occur after 'ribonu'." name="assert">

  <style>
  div
    {
      border: black solid 2px;
      font-family: monospace;
      font-size: 32px;
      margin-bottom: 0.25em;
      width: 8ch;
    }

    {
      hyphens: manual;
    }

  div#reference
    {
      hyphens: none;
    }
  </style>

  <p>Test passes if the characters inside of each black-bordered rectangles are laid out identically.

  <div>DNA <span id="test">means Deo&shy;xy&shy;ribo&shy;nu&shy;cleic acid</span>.</div>

  <div id="reference">DNA means Deoxy-ribonu-cleic acid.</div>
