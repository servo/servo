    <meta name="assert" content='"If the root element is transformed, the
    transformation applies to the entire canvas, including any background
    specified for the root element. Since the background painting area for the
    root element is the entire canvas, which is infinite, the transformation
    might cause parts of the background that were originally off-screen to
    appear. For example, if the root element&apos;s background were repeating
    dots, and a transformation of &apos;scale(0.5)&apos; were specified on the
    root element, the dots would shrink to half their size, but there will be
    twice as many, so they still cover the whole viewport."  In this case, the
    background is specified on the body but propagates to the root element.
    The transform is on the root element, so it needs to affect the background.
    The rotation 90 degrees clockwise means that most of the screen will be
    filled with triangles that were originally above the top of the viewport;
    the original top row of triangles will now be on the left.'>
