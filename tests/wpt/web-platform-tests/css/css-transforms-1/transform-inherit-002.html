    <meta name="assert" content='The &apos;transform&apos; property&apos;s
    computed value (which is what&apos;s inherited if &apos;inherit&apos; is
    specified) is defined as "As specified, but with relative lengths converted
    into absolute lengths."  In this test, a parent element has a transform of
    10% with a height/width of 400px, and the child has "transform: inherit"
    and a height/width of 100px.  Since percentages are not relative lengths
    and are inherited as specified, the parent should be translated by 40px and
    then the child by only 10px, for a total of 50px.  An implementation that
    incorrectly converted the parent&apos;s 10% transform into 40px before
    inheritance would translate the child by a further 40px, for a total of
    80px.'>
