// This test fetches resources/accept_ch_lifetime.html. The response headers to
// that webpage contain Accept-CH and Accept-CH-Lifetime headers.
// Fetching that webpage should cause the user-agent to persist origin
// preferences for the client hints specified in Accept-CH header for a
// duration specified in the Accept-CH-Lifetime header.

// Next, to verify if the origin preferences were persisted by the user
// agent, this test fetches resources/expect_client_hints_headers.html
// in a new window. Fetching of resources/expect_client_hints_headers.html
// verifies that the user agent actually sends the client hints in the request
// headers.

// Verify the initial state to make sure that the browser does not have client
// hints preferences cached from a previous run of the test.

// Test is marked as tentative until https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/726
// is resolved.
