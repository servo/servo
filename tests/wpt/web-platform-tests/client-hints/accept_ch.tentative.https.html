// This test fetches resources/accept_ch.html. The response headers to
// that webpage contains only the Accept-CH header. Due to the missing
// Accept-CH-Lifetime header, the user-agent should not persist origin
// preferences for the client hints specified in Accept-CH header.

// Next, to verify that the origin preferences were not persisted by the user
// agent, this test fetches resources/do_not_expect_client_hints_headers.html
// in a new window. Fetching of
// resources/do_not_expect_client_hints_headers.html
// verifies that the user agent does not send the client hints in the request
// headers.

// Verify the initial state to make sure that the browser does not have client
// hints preferences cached from a previous run of the test.

// Test is marked as tentative until https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/726
// is resolved.
