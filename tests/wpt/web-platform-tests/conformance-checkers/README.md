# WPT conformance-checker tests

The files in this part of the tree are not browser tests; they're documents
intended for testing the behavior of conformance checkers (e.g., validator.nu
and the W3C Nu Markup Validator).

TK: We should have here some details about the contents of the existing
subdirectories in this tree...

Curious committers should see the makefile.
