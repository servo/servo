<h1>Shared Web Worker Tests</h1>
<p>Demonstrates running <tt>testharness</tt> based tests inside a shared worker.
<p>The test harness should time out due to one of the tests in the worker timing out.
<p>This test assumes that the browser supports <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#shared-workers-and-the-sharedworker-interface">shared web workers</a>.
