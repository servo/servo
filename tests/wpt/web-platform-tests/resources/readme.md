## Introduction ##

testharness.js provides a framework for writing low-level tests of
browser functionality in javascript. It provides a convenient API for
making assertions and is intended to work for both simple synchronous
tests and for tests of asynchronous behaviour.

## Getting Started ##

To use testharness.js you must include two scripts, in the order given:

``` html
<script src="/resources/testharness.js"></script>
<script src="/resources/testharnessreport.js"></script>
```

## Full documentation ##

Full user documentation for the API is at [http://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html](http://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html).
