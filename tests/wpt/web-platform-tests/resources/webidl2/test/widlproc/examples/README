This examples directory contains two of the BONDI .widl files, a Makefile
that processes them to generate html, and a .css file that the resulting
html uses.

The Makefile processes the .widl files as follows:

 1. For each .widl, generate the .widlprocxml file (an XML representation
    of the information in the .widl) using widlproc.

 2. Validate (using xmllint) each .widlprocxml against the DTD.

 3. We want any reference in the resulting html to a type elsewhere in the
    API to be a link. This is where we achieve this. First generate a
    list of fqids (fully qualified identifiers) from fqid attributes in
    the XML by running all .widlprocxml files through the style sheet
    widlprocxmlfqids.xsl.

 4. Turn that list of fqids into a sed script that turns a <ref> to an
    fqid into a <ref ref=".."> to the fqid in the right .html file.

 5. For each .widlprocxml file, generate a .widlprocxml2 file by running
    it through the sed script generated above.

 6. For each .widlprocxml2 file, generate a .html file by running it through
    the widlprocxmltohtml.xsl style sheet.

See the Makefile for details.
