# WebIDL 2

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/webidl2.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/webidl2)

## Purpose

This is a parser for the [WebIDL](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/) language. If
you don't know what that is, then you probably don't need it. It is meant to be used
both in Node and in the browser (the parser likely works in other JS environments, but
not the test suite).

## Installation

Just the usual. For Node:

```Bash
npm install webidl2
```

In the browser:

```HTML
<script src='webidl2.js'></script>
```

## Documentation

The API to WebIDL2 is trivial: you parse a string of WebIDL and it returns a syntax tree.

### Parsing

In Node, that happens with:

```JS
var WebIDL2 = require("webidl2");
var tree = WebIDL2.parse("string of WebIDL");
```

In the browser:
```HTML
<script src='webidl2.js'></script>
<script>
  var tree = WebIDL2.parse("string of WebIDL");
</script>
```

### Advanced Parsing

`parse()` can optionally accept a second parameter, an options object, which can be used to
modify parsing behavior.

The following options are recognized:
```JS
{
  allowNestedTypedefs: false
}
```

And their meanings are as follows:

* `allowNestedTypedefs`: Boolean indicating whether the parser should accept `typedef`s as valid members of `interface`s.
This is non-standard syntax and therefore the default is `false`.

### Errors

When there is a syntax error in the WebIDL, it throws an exception object with the following
properties:

* `message`: the error message
* `line`: the line at which the error occurred.
* `input`: a short peek at the text at the point where the error happened
* `tokens`: the five tokens at the point of error, as understood by the tokeniser
  (this is the same content as `input`, but seen from the tokeniser's point of view)

The exception also has a `toString()` method that hopefully should produce a decent
error message.

### AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

The `parse()` method returns a tree object representing the parse tree of the IDL.
Comment and white space are not represented in the AST.

The root of this object is always an array of definitions (where definitions are
any of interfaces, dictionaries, callbacks, etc. â€” anything that can occur at the root
of the IDL).

### IDL Type

This structure is used in many other places (operation return types, argument types, etc.).
It captures a WebIDL type with a number of options. Types look like this and are typically
attached to a field called `idlType`:

```JS
{
  "sequence": false,
  "generic": null,
  "idlType": "void",
  "nullable": false,
  "union": false,
}
```

Where the fields are as follows:

* `sequence`: Boolean indicating if it is a sequence. Same as `generic === "sequence"`.
* `generic`: String indicating the generic type (e.g. "Promise", "sequence"). `null`
  otherwise.
* `idlType`: Can be different things depending on context. In most cases, this will just
  be a string with the type name. But the reason this field isn't called "typeName" is
  because it can take more complex values. If the type is a union, then this contains an
  array of the types it unites. If it is a generic type, it contains the IDL type
  description for the type in the sequence, the eventual value of the promise, etc.
* `nullable`: Boolean indicating whether this is nullable or not.
* `union`: Boolean indicating whether this is a union type or not.

### Interface

Interfaces look like this:

```JS
{
  "type": "interface",
  "name": "Animal",
  "partial": false,
  "members": [...],
  "inheritance": null,
  "extAttrs": [...]
}, {
  "type": "interface",
  "name": "Human",
  "partial": false,
  "members": [...],
  "inheritance": "Animal",
  "extAttrs": [...]
}
```

The fields are as follows:

* `type`: Always "interface".
* `name`: The name of the interface.
* `partial`: A boolean indicating whether it's a partial interface.
* `members`: An array of interface members (attributes, operations, etc.). Empty if there are none.
* `inheritance`: A string giving the name of an interface this one inherits from, `null` otherwise.
  **NOTE**: In v1 this was an array, but multiple inheritance is no longer supported so this didn't make
  sense.
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).

### Interface mixins

Interfaces mixins look like this:

```JS
{
  "type": "interface mixin",
  "name": "Animal",
  "partial": false,
  "members": [...],
  "extAttrs": [...]
}, {
  "type": "interface mixin",
  "name": "Human",
  "partial": false,
  "members": [...],
  "extAttrs": [...]
}
```

The fields are as follows:

* `type`: Always "interface mixin".
* `name`: The name of the interface mixin.
* `partial`: A boolean indicating whether it's a partial interface mixin.
* `members`: An array of interface members (attributes, operations, etc.). Empty if there are none.
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).

### Namespace

* `type`: Always "namespace".
* `name`: The name of the namespace.

* `members`: An array of namespace members (attributes and operations). Empty if there are none.
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).

### Callback Interfaces

These are captured by the same structure as [Interfaces](#interface) except that
their `type` field is "callback interface".

* `readonly`: True if it's a read-only attribute.
* `idlType`: An [IDL Type](#idl-type) for the attribute.
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).

### Constant Member

A constant member looks like this:

```JS

* `value`: The constant value as described by [Const Values](#default-and-const-values)
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).

### Arguments

The arguments (e.g. for an operation) look like this:

```JS
{
  "arguments": [{
    "optional": false,
    "variadic": true,
    "extAttrs": [],
    "idlType": {
      "sequence": false,
      "generic": null,
      "nullable": false,
      "union": false,
      "idlType": "long"
    },
    "name": "ints"
  }]
}
```

The fields are as follows:

* `optional`: True if the argument is optional.

* `idlType`: An [IDL Type](#idl-type) describing the type of the argument.
* `name`: The argument's name.
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).

### Extended Attributes

Extended attributes are arrays of items that look like this:

```JS
{
  "extAttrs": [{
    "name": "TreatNullAs",
    "arguments": null,
    "type": "extended-attribute",
    "rhs": {
      "type": "identifier",
      "value": "EmptyString"
    }
  }]
}
```

The fields are as follows:

* `name`: The extended attribute's name.
* `arguments`: If the extended attribute takes arguments (e.g. `[Foo()]`) or if
  its right-hand side does (e.g. `[NamedConstructor=Name(DOMString blah)]`) they
  are listed here. Note that an empty arguments list will produce an empty array,
  whereas the lack thereof will yield a `null`. If there is an `rhs` field then
  they are the right-hand side's arguments, otherwise they apply to the extended
  attribute directly.
* `type`: Always `"extended-attribute"`.
* `rhs`: If there is a right-hand side, this will capture its `type` (which can be
  "identifier" or "identifier-list") and its `value`.
* `typePair`: If the extended attribute is a `MapClass` this will capture the
  map's key type and value type respectively.

### Default and Const Values

Dictionary fields and operation arguments can take default values, and constants take
values, all of which have the following fields:

* `type`: One of string, number, boolean, null, Infinity, NaN, or sequence.

For string, number, boolean, and sequence:

* `value`: The value of the given type, as a string. For sequence, the only possible value is `[]`.

For Infinity:

* `negative`: Boolean indicating whether this is negative Infinity or not.

### `iterable<>`, `legacyiterable<>`, `maplike<>`, `setlike<>` declarations

These appear as members of interfaces that look like this:

```JS
{
  "type": "maplike", // or "legacyiterable" / "iterable" / "setlike"
  "idlType": /* One or two types */ ,
  "readonly": false, // only for maplike and setlike
  "extAttrs": []
}
```

The fields are as follows:

* `type`: Always one of "iterable", "legacyiterable", "maplike" or "setlike".
* `idlType`: An array with one or more [IDL Types](#idl-type) representing the declared type arguments.
* `readonly`: Whether the maplike or setlike is declared as read only.
* `extAttrs`: A list of [extended attributes](#extended-attributes).


## Testing

In order to run the tests you need to ensure that the widlproc submodule inside `test` is
initialized and up to date:

```Bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Running

The test runs with mocha and expect.js. Normally, running mocha in the root directory
should be enough once you're set up.

### Coverage

Current test coverage, as documented in `coverage.html`, is 95%. You can run your own
coverage analysis with:

```Bash
jscoverage lib lib-cov
```

That will create the lib-cov directory with instrumented code; the test suite knows
to use that if needed. You can then run the tests with:

```Bash
JSCOV=1 mocha --reporter html-cov > coverage.html
```

Note that I've been getting weirdly overescaped results from the html-cov reporter,
so you might wish to try this instead:

```Bash
JSCOV=1 mocha  --reporter html-cov | sed "s/&lt;/</g" | sed "s/&gt;/>/g" | sed "s/&quot;/\"/g" > coverage.html
```
### Browser tests

In order to test in the browser, get inside `test/web` and run `make-web-tests.js`. This
will generate a `browser-tests.html` file that you can open in a browser. As of this
writing tests pass in the latest Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari. Testing on IE
and older versions will happen progressively.
