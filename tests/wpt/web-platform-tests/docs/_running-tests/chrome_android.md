To run WPT on Chrome on an Android device, some additional set up is required.

First of all, as usual Android development, we need to have `adb` and be able to
connect to the device.

Furthermore, until we find a better way, we need to root the Android device and
update the /etc/hosts file to include

```
127.0.0.1   web-platform.test
127.0.0.1   www.web-platform.test
127.0.0.1   www1.web-platform.test
127.0.0.1   www2.web-platform.test
127.0.0.1   xn--n8j6ds53lwwkrqhv28a.web-platform.test
127.0.0.1   xn--lve-6lad.web-platform.test
0.0.0.0     nonexistent-origin.web-platform.test
```

After this, we may run wpt with the `chrome_android` product

```
./wpt run chrome_android [test_list]
```
