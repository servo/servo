title: Running Tests

The simplest way to run the tests is via the public website. More detail on
that approach is available in [Running tests from the Web][from-web].

Contributors who are interested in modifying and creating tests should refer to
[Running Tests from the Local System][from-local-system].

Advanced use cases may call for a customized method of executing the tests.
Guidelines for writing a custom "runner" are available at [Writing Your Own
Runner][custom-runner].
