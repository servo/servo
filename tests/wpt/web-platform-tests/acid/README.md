## The Acid Tests

This directory contains copies of Acid2 and Acid3, based on the
copies hosted at [acidtests.org](http://www.acidtests.org) after they
had ceased being maintained (per the note on that page).

Note these are not maintained here for the sake of providing any
useful guide of interoperability or standards compliance, but rather
for browser vendors' convenience. It would be inappropriate,
therefore, to use them as part of a certification process.

Acid1 can be found at `css/CSS2/css1/c5526c-display-000.xht`, as it
always formed part of the CSS1 testsuite.

The tests themselves (i.e., those at `/` of their respective
subdomains at `acidtests.org`) are in files named test.html in their
respective directories.
