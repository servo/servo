# XPath

This directory contains tests for [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/).

See [whatwg/dom#67](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/67) for getting XPath
better specified.

Because the XPath interfaces are defined in the DOM Standard, the idlharness.js
tests are in [/dom]([/dom) instead of here.
