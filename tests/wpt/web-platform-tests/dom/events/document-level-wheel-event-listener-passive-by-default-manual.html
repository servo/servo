<div>This is a manual test since there is no way to synthesize wheel events.
Scroll by wheel in the middle of the page to run the test.</div>
<script>
function testWheelCancelable(test) {
  document.addEventListener("wheel", test.step_func(event => {
    assert_false(event.cancelable, "Wheel event must be non-cancelable.");
    test.done();
  }));
}
async_test(t => { testWheelCancelable(t); }, "Wheel events are " +
    "non-cancelable since the event listener is treated as passive");
