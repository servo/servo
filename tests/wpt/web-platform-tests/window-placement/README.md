# Window Management Testing

[Window Management Specification](https://w3c.github.io/window-placement/)

The tests in this directory require at least 2 displays on the host machine to yield meaningful results. A well-supported configuration is 2 displays at 1920x1080 resolution arranged horizonally (primary on the left, secondary on the right).
