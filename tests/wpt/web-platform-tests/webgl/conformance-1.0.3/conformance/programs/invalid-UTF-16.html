array.push(String.fromCharCode(0x48)); // H
array.push(String.fromCharCode(0x69)); // i
array.push(String.fromCharCode(0xd87e)); // Bogus
var string = array.join('');

// In order to make this test not depend on WebGL, the following were
// attempted:
//  - Send a string to console.log
//  - Submit a mailto: form containing a text input with the bogus
//    string
// The first code path does not perform a utf8 conversion of the
// incoming string unless Console::shouldPrintExceptions() returns
// true. The second seems to sanitize the form's input before
// converting it to a UTF8 string.
