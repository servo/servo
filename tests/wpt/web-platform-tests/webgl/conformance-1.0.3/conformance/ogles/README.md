OpenGL ES 2.0 GLSL conformance tests
====================================

The python script, process-ogles2-tests.py, in this folder generates some
WebGL conformance tests from a subset of the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance
tests.

To run it you must have a copy of the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance test
source then run it like this

    python process-ogles2-tests.py <path/to/ogles2tests>/GTF_ES/glsl/GTF/mustpass.run

Note: Before running you can safely delete the GTF_ES folder in this
folder. Everything inside will be regenerated by the script above.

IMPORTANT: From the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance tests only the .vert and
.frag files are open source licenesed. All other files in that suite are
not open source.
