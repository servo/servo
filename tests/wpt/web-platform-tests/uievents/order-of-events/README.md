Order of events
============================

Testing of how events fire in relation to one another

(this is the big work item)

Expecting to need:
 * braindead test (does it work at all?)
 * specific functional tests
 * specific edge cases

Notes:
 * small tests so that they can be given specific names for what's broken if it fails
 * include a link to the corresponding test in the spec.
