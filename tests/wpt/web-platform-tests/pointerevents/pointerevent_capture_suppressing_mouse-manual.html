        <h1>Pointer Events capture test</h1>
        <h4>
            Test Description: This test checks if setCapture/releaseCapture functions works properly. Complete the following actions:
            <ol>
                <li> Put your mouse over the black rectangle. pointerover and pointerenter should be logged inside of it.</li>
                <li> Move your mouse out of the black rectangle. pointerout and pointerleave should be logged inside of it</li>
                <li> Put your mouse over the purple rectangle. pointerover and pointerenter should be logged inside of it.</li>
                <li> Move your mouse out of the purple rectangle. pointerout and pointerleave should be logged inside of it</li>
                <li> Press and hold left mouse button over "Set Capture" button and move mouse a litte inside the button. "gotpointercapture", "pointerover", and "pointerenter" should be logged in the black rectangle</li>
                <li> Put your mouse over the purple rectangle and then move it out. Nothing should happen</li>
                <li> Put your mouse over the black rectangle and then move it out. Nothing should happen.</li>
                <li> Put your mouse over the purple rectangle and then release left mouse button. "lostpointercapture" should be logged in the black rectangle. Move your mouse in the purple rectangle a little. "pointerout" and "pointerleave" should be logged in the black rectangle. Also "pointerover" and "pointerenter" should be logged in the purple rectangle"</li>
            </ol>

        Test passes if the proper behaviour of the events is observed.
