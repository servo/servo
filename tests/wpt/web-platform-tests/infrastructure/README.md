This directory contains a number of tests to ensure test running
infrastructure is operating correctly:

 * The tests in assumptions/ are designed to test UA assumptions
   documented in [assumptions.md](/docs/_writing-tests/assumptions.md).

 * The tests in server/ are designed to test the WPT server configuration

 * The tests in expected-fail/ should all fail.
