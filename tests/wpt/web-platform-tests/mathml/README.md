# MathML: Tests for the MathML in HTML5 implementation note

This directory contains tests for the
[MathML in HTML5 implementation note](http://www.mathml-association.org/MathMLinHTML5/)
which is itself based on the
[HTML5 W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/),
on the [MathML3 W3C recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/)
and on the
[Open Font Format 3](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=66391) standard.

Many of the tests verify OpenType features and require specific Web fonts for
that purpose. WOFF fonts are generated by scripts in the `tools/` folder using
the Python API of
[fontforge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/). A recent enough version
of FontForge is necessary so that it includes fixes for
[WOFF checkSumAdjustment](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/926),
[USE_TYPO_METRICS flag](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/pull/2274) and
for other various bugs.
