<!-- Test verifies that CORB blocks an image mislabeled as text/html if
  sniffing is disabled via `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` response header.
  This has an observable effect (the image stops rendering), compared to the
  behavior with no CORB.

<!-- www1 is cross-origin, so the HTTP response is CORB-eligible

TODO(lukasza@chromium.org): Once https://crbug.com/888079 and
https://crbug.com/891872 are fixed, we should use a cross-*origin*
rather than cross-*site* URL below (e.g. s/hosts[alt]/domains/g).
See also https://crbug.com/918660 for more context.
