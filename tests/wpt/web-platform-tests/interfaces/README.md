This directory contains [Web IDL](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/) interface definitions for use in idlharness.js tests.

The `.idl` files (except `*.tentative.idl`) are copied from [@webref/idl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/idl) by a [workflow](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/.github/workflows/interfaces.yml) that tries to sync the files daily. The resulting pull requests require manual review but can be approved/merged by anyone with write access.
