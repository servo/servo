Our test suite is currently tracking the [editor's draft](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) of the Web Audio API.

The tests are arranged in subdirectories, corresponding to different
sections of the spec. So, for example, tests for the `DelayNode` are
in `the-audio-api/the-delaynode-interface`.
