Our test suite is currently tracking the [editor's draft](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html) of the Web Audio API.

The tests are arranged in subdirectories, corresponding to different
sections of the spec. So, for example, tests for the `DelayNode` are
in `the-audio-api/the-delaynode-interface`.
