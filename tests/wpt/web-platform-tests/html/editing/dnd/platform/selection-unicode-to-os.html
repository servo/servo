		<title>drag and drop - dragging a selection containing unicode onto the OS</title>
	</head>
	<body>

		<p>This test is only relevant on platforms where it is possible to switch applications in mid-drag (eg. alt+tab, dragging over taskbar buttons, dragging between restored windows).</p>
		<p>This testcase requires an external application that accepts dropping of text from other applications, and supports unicode - eg. Wordpad (write.exe) on Windows. Ensure that the external application is open.</p>
		<p>Select the following non-English text --> 中文אידישрусский &lt;-- Drag the selection to the other application and release it. Pass if the text you selected appears in the other application, and the drag placeholder disappears when the drag is released.</p>
