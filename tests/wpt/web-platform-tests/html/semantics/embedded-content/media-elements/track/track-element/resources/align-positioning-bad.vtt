Either one or both of positioning and alignment values are invalid.

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.500 position:10% align: start
Bear is Coming!!!!!
Positioning on the left bottom, middle aligned,
because the alignment is mistyped.

2
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:45.500 position:200% align:middle
I said Bear is coming!!!!
Positioning on the bottom middle, middle aligned,
because the positioning is off.

3
00:01:01.000 --> 00:02:00.500 position:-80% align:ends
I said Bear is coming now!!!!
Positioning on the bottom middle, middle aligned,
because both the alignment and positioning don't apply.
