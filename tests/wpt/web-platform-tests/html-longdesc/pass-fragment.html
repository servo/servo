  <h1>Fail if you land here</h1>
<div style="height:200em">
<p>This is a landing page for tests of the longdesc attribute. To pass, when opening a longdesc that points to this page, the focus should be on a heading with the text "pass" followed by a description of an image</p>

<div id="fragment" style="min-height:20em">
  <h1>Pass</h1>
 <p>The image is a drawn cartoon, on the left is a parson in a wheelchair in profile, facing toward the centre of the image, under a banner with the text "e-democracy?" on it. In front of the person is stairs, at the top of the stairs is a table. On the table is a computer, whose screen says "Vote!" and has a red and a green button</p>
 <p>The image is signed in the space under the floor that is at the top of the stairs with an "R" rune flipped backwards, somewhat resembling a "Я" with top and bottom border lines sloping upward from left to right, and is marked ©2013. It was actually drawn by Charles McCathie Nevile.</p>

<p>This paragraph is not part of the description. As of September 2013 there is no conformance requirement making it a failure to read this paragraph, best practice would be to present only the description, and not this part.</p>
<p>The description is encapsulated in a well-formed div element, so it is possible to identify it.</p>
