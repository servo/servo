class Session(object):
    """Fixture to allow access to wptrunner's existing WebDriver session
    in tests.

    The session is not created by default to enable testing of session
    creation.  However, a function-scoped session will be implicitly created
    at the first call to a WebDriver command.  This means methods such as
    `session.send_command` and `session.session_id` are possible to use
    without having a session.

    To illustrate implicit session creation::

        def test_session_scope(session):
            # at this point there is no session
            assert session.session_id is None

            # window_id is a WebDriver command,
            # and implicitly creates the session for us
            assert session.window_id is not None

            # we now have a session
            assert session.session_id is not None

    You can also access the session in custom fixtures defined in the
    tests, such as a setup function::

        @pytest.fixture(scope="function")
        def setup(request, session):
            session.url = "https://example.org"

        def test_something(setup, session):
            assert session.url == "https://example.org"

    When the test function goes out of scope, any remaining user prompts
    and opened windows are closed, and the current browsing context is
    switched back to the top-level browsing context.
