    <ol>
        <li>If the user-agent does not claim to support the <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class (e.g. the pointing device cannot detect hovering), then SKIP this test.</li>
        <li>If the user-agent does not allow scrolling the document while leaving the pointer in the same position relative to the viewport, then SKIP this test.</li>
        <li>Ensure that this document is scrolled all the way to the top.</li>
        <li>Hover the pointer device over the button below.</li>
        <li>If the button is not blue, then the test result is FAILURE.</li>
        <li>
            Scroll this document down while not moving the pointer at all, until the pointer no longer touches the button. For example, on a traditional desktop or laptop computer, keep the mouse perfectly still and do one of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Press the "Page Down" key on the keyboard.</li>
                <li>Press the "â†“" key on the keyboard.</li>
                <li>Roll the mouse's scrollwheel.</li>
                <li>Perform a "scroll down" gesture on the trackpad</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the button is blue, then the test result is FAILURE. If the button is white, then the test result is SUCCESS.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <button>Hover over me.</button>
