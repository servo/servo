That means that the margin-left of div#preceding-sibling must not collapse with the right margin of the div#clearing-left and clearance must be added such that clearance + margin-right of div#clearing-left = 50px, i.e., clearance = 50px - margin-right of div#clearing-left; therefore clearance is equal to 50px - 75px = - 25px.
