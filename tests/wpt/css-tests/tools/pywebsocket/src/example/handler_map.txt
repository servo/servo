# websocket handler map file, used by standalone.py -m option.
# A line starting with '#' is a comment line.
# Each line consists of 'alias_resource_path' and 'existing_resource_path'
# separated by spaces.
# Aliasing is processed from the top to the bottom of the line, and
# 'existing_resource_path' must exist before it is aliased.
# For example,
#  / /echo
# means that a request to '/' will be handled by handlers for '/echo'.
/ /echo
