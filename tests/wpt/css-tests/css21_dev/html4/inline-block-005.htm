  <p> Make your window an inch or two bigger than than the width of
  one inline-block. All inline-blocks should be the same size. Try
  resizing the window so that inline-blocks wrap in one or two
  columns. </p>
  <p>The first line is indented. Therefore, the first block on the first line, if the
  line is short enough, should end up wrapping onto two lines internally. In addition
  each inline-block has 5em indentation on the left and 5em padding on the right,
  which should make no difference except that the boxes should be slightly wider than
   <a href="002.html">before</a>. They shouldn't wrap particularily more than before.</p>
