    <meta content="This tests that if an element has
    'backface-visibility: hidden' and is rotated 180deg, so it would normally
    disappear, it doesn't reappear just because its parent also has a 180deg
    rotation.  The rotations don't cancel, since the parent doesn't have
    'transform-style: preserve-3d' and is in a different rendering context." name="assert">
