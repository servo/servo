    <meta content="The 'transform' property's
    computed value (which is what's inherited if 'inherit' is
    specified) is defined as &quot;As specified, but with relative lengths converted
    into absolute lengths.&quot;  In this test, a parent element has a transform of
    10% with a height/width of 400px, and the child has &quot;transform: inherit&quot;
    and a height/width of 100px.  Since percentages are not relative lengths
    and are inherited as specified, the parent should be translated by 40px and
    then the child by only 10px, for a total of 50px.  An implementation that
    incorrectly converted the parent's 10% transform into 40px before
    inheritance would translate the child by a further 40px, for a total of
    80px." name="assert">
