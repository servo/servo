    <meta content="The 'transform' property's
    computed value (which is what's inherited if 'inherit' is
    specified) is defined as &quot;As specified, but with relative lengths converted
    into absolute lengths.&quot;  In this test, a parent element has a transform of
    1em with a font-size of 25px, and the child has &quot;transform: inherit&quot;.
    Since the relative length of 1em is converted to an absolute length of 25px
    before inheritance, the child should be translated by a further 25px, for a
    total of 50px, even though its font-size is 100px.  An implementation that
    incorrectly inherited 1em without converting it to an absolute length first
    would translate by 125px." name="assert">
