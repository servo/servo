    scale(-1).  It also specifies a transform-origin, because the default of
    50% 50% wouldn't work well with the way the reference image is constructed." name="assert" />

         * at a multiple of 100px.  Otherwise after the transform, the shrunken
         * images won't line up with the left edge of the body, and it won't
         * match the ref (since the background here is positioned at the left).
