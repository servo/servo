    <title>CSS Test (Transforms): scale(-1) on Root Element With Background</title>

    <meta content="The background here extends to the whole
    canvas, and a transform on the root element must transform the whole
    canvas, background included.  Thus the entire tiled background of
    left-pointing triangles needs to be rotated 180 degrees (same as scale(-1))
    around the top center of the viewport, which is the default
    transform-origin of 50% 50% in this case.  An implementation that doesn't
    draw the background on parts of the canvas outside the viewport might
    incorrectly display nothing, because the part of the background that's
    supposed to be rotated into view was initially above the visible part of
    the canvas." name="assert" />
