GLSL 1.017 section 4.2.6

...

With the exception of uniform declarations, vertex and fragment shaders
have separate name spaces.  Functions and global variables declared in a
vertex shader cannot be referenced by a fragment shader and vice versa.
Uniforms have a single name space.  Uniforms declared with the same name
must have matching types and precisions.

Section 4.3.3

Attribute variables are required to have global scope

Section 4.3.4

The uniform qualifier is used to declare global variables

QED: If both uniforms and attributes are in the global namespace they
conflict across shaders

Note: This was brought up on the OpenGL ES working group and confirmed
that the spec required these conflicts to fail to link.

Though most drivers allow this to work, some drivers to do no therefore
WebGL implementation must enforce this restriction to provide consistent
behavior.
