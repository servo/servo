// Disable this entire crate on Windows when Gecko symbols are not available
// as linking would fail:
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/44603#issuecomment-338807312
//
// On Linux and OS X linking succeeds anyway.
// Presumably these symbol declarations don’t need to be resolved
// as they’re not used in any code called from this crate.
