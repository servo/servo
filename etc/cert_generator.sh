# 1. Mozilla's official CA database CSV file is downloaded with curl
#    and processed with awk.
# 2. Rows end with `"\n`.
# 3. Each row is split by ^" and "," into columns.
# 4. Single and double quotes are removed from column 30.
# 5. If column 13 (12 in the csv file) contains `Websites`
#    (some are Email-only), column 30 is printed, the raw certificate.
# 6. All CA certs trusted for Websites are stored into the `certs` file.
