# We shouldn't need any binary at all to update the manifests.
# Adding "SKIP_TESTS" to skip tests, it doesn't really skip the tests.
# It will run "run_wpt" with "'test_list': ['SKIP_TESTS']",
# and then pass it into wptrunner, which won't be able to find any tests named
# "SKIP_TESTS", and thus won't run any.
# Adding "--binary=" to skip looking for a compiled servo binary.
