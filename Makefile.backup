# Build commands for backing up and restoring the Rust build.
# Because Rust takes a very long time to build and changes infrequently,
# the bots want to reuse it between builds. They can do so by running
# `make backup-rust` and `make restore-rust`.
#
# backup-rust is run before the build directory is cleaned. if it fails, that's ok.
#
# restore-rust is run after configure and before invoking make. if it fails, we must abort.
